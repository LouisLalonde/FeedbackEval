@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains an infinite loop due to the use of `while True` without any exit condition, which will prevent the function from completing. Additionally, the code lacks the necessary iteration over the list elements, as it does not define or utilize indices (`idx` and `idx2`) or elements (`elem` and `elem2`) properly. To improve the code, consider using nested loops with `enumerate` to iterate through the list of numbers, ensuring that each pair of elements is compared correctly while avoiding redundant comparisons.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains an infinite loop due to the `while True` statement, which prevents it from iterating over the input list, leading to a runtime error. Instead, consider using a `for` loop to iterate through the `numbers` list, ensuring that each integer is processed correctly for both the sum and product calculations. Additionally, ensure that the function handles the case of an empty list appropriately by initializing the sum and product values as specified in the docstring.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly increments the current number `n` by 1 before comparing it to the running maximum, which alters the intended logic of finding the maximum value in the sequence. To improve the code, ensure that the comparison is made directly between `running_max` and `n`, as this will yield the correct rolling maximum values. Additionally, consider initializing `running_max` with the first element of the list if it is not empty, which can simplify the logic and avoid the initial `None` check.

The primary issue in the @@Existing Code is the incorrect use of the division operator (`/`) instead of the concatenation operator (`+`) when returning the final palindrome string, which will lead to a runtime error.

Additionally, consider adding more test cases to cover edge cases, such as strings with whitespace or special characters, to enhance the robustness of the function.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly identifies the largest divisor by returning the first number that does not divide evenly into `n`, rather than the first number that does; this leads to incorrect results. Additionally, the loop starts from `n-1` and goes down to `1`, which is correct, but the condition should check for divisibility (`n % i == 0`) instead of non-divisibility. To improve clarity and efficiency, consider breaking out of the loop as soon as the correct divisor is found, ensuring the function returns the expected result.

The existing code incorrectly uses a `for` loop with a fixed range of 5, which limits the factorization to only small integers and does not account for larger values of `n`.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a logical error in the conditions of the while loops within the `find_zero` function; using `>=` instead of `>` could lead to an infinite loop if the polynomial evaluates to zero at either `begin` or `end`. Additionally, consider using a more descriptive variable name for `center` to enhance code readability, as it represents the midpoint of the search interval. Lastly, ensure that the documentation accurately reflects the behavior of the function, particularly regarding the conditions under which it is guaranteed to find a zero.

The existing code incorrectly uses `3.0` as the step in the slicing operation, which leads to a TypeError since slice steps must be integers; using `3` instead will resolve this issue.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a couple of key issues compared to the correct version. First, the group splitting logic in the `encode_cyclic` function should use `(len(s) + 2) // 3` to ensure all characters are included in the last group, especially when the string length is not a multiple of three. Additionally, the cycling logic should shift the characters correctly by moving the first character to the end, which is done by `(group[1:] + group[0])` instead of the current approach, which incorrectly shifts the last two characters to the front. Lastly, the `decode_cyclic` function should call the encoding function twice to reverse the encoding process, ensuring that the original string is accurately restored.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has several issues, such as incorrect function calls and logic errors in the `is_prime` function, where it lacks a proper upper limit for the loop and incorrectly uses `int()` without an argument. Additionally, the Fibonacci sequence generation and prime checking logic need to be correctly implemented to ensure that the function accurately identifies the n-th prime Fibonacci number. To improve the code, focus on refining the prime-checking logic by using the square root of the number for efficiency, and ensure that the Fibonacci sequence is generated correctly before checking for primality.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly checks for a sum of one instead of zero, which is a fundamental misunderstanding of the function's purpose. Additionally, the triple nested loop approach can be inefficient for larger lists; consider using a more optimal algorithm, such as sorting the list and using a two-pointer technique, to reduce time complexity.

The existing code contains an infinite loop due to the absence of a loop control variable, which prevents it from iterating through the string properly; using a `for` loop, as shown in the correct code, is a more effective approach. Additionally, the existing code does not handle the case where the length of the string exceeds the index range, which could lead to an `IndexError`.

Instead, using `set` provides a more efficient solution, as it directly compares the unique characters in both strings without considering their frequencies. Additionally, the `Counter` method may lead to incorrect results in cases where the character counts differ but the unique characters are the same, while the `set` method accurately reflects the requirement of having the same characters regardless of their counts.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains incorrect base cases for the Fibonacci sequence, as it returns 2 for `n == 2` instead of 1, and it incorrectly uses `fib(n - 3)` instead of `fib(n - 2)`, leading to incorrect results for higher values of `n`. To improve the code, ensure that the base cases correctly reflect the Fibonacci sequence, starting with `fib(0) = 0` and `fib(1) = 1`, and adjust the recursive calls to follow the correct Fibonacci definition. Additionally, consider implementing memoization or an iterative approach to optimize performance and avoid excessive recursion, especially for larger values of `n`.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a critical error in the logic for handling closing brackets, where it incorrectly increments the `depth` instead of decrementing it, which will lead to incorrect results for inputs with unmatched brackets. To improve the code, ensure that the decrement operation accurately reflects the closing of an opening bracket, as this is essential for correctly tracking the balance of brackets. Additionally, consider adding input validation to handle unexpected characters, which would enhance the robustness of the function.

The existing code contains several issues: it incorrectly initializes the set with a number (80) instead of an empty set, and it fails to add the common elements correctly, as the `add()` method is called without an argument. Additionally, the final return statement attempts to sort an empty call instead of converting the set to a list first, which would lead to errors.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has several issues, primarily related to the use of floating-point numbers instead of integers, which can lead to unexpected behavior and inefficiencies. Additionally, the `is_prime` function should return boolean values (`True` or `False`) instead of `1.0` and `0.0`, improving readability and aligning with Python conventions.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly calculates the derivative by multiplying the coefficient by the index and then by 2, which does not align with the mathematical definition of a polynomial derivative. The correct approach should simply multiply the coefficient by its index without the additional factor of 2. Additionally, ensure that the return statement correctly excludes the constant term (the first coefficient), which is already handled in both versions.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly handles the base cases for `fibfib(1)`, returning 1 instead of 0, and it also uses an iterative approach that may not be necessary given the recursive definition of the sequence. Additionally, the iterative method can lead to inefficiencies for larger values of `n`, while a recursive approach, despite its own drawbacks, aligns better with the mathematical definition provided.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a couple of issues: it incorrectly initializes the frequency list with `max(lst, 47)`, which can lead to an incorrect size, and it uses `len()` without an argument, which will cause an error. Additionally, the loop iterating through the frequency list should start from 1 to avoid checking the frequency of 0, which is unnecessary in this context. To improve clarity and maintainability, consider adding comments to explain the logic behind the frequency counting and the conditions being checked.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a logical error in the initial value of the `switch` variable; it should start as `True` to correctly alternate between selecting the minimum and maximum values. Additionally, using `remove` on the list can lead to inefficiencies, especially with larger lists, as it requires searching for the item to remove each time; consider using a different approach to manage the list. Lastly, consider the implications of modifying the input list directly, as it may lead to unintended side effects if the original list is needed later.

The existing code for `is_multiply_prime` only counts the number of distinct prime factors of `a`, which does not ensure that `a` is the product of exactly three primes; it could mistakenly return `True` for numbers with more than three prime factors. The correct approach involves generating all combinations of three primes and checking if their product equals `a`, which guarantees that the function accurately identifies the multiplication of exactly three prime numbers.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a significant limitation in that it only checks for powers of `n` up to `n^5`, which may not cover all possible values of `x` when `n` is greater than 1. Instead, consider using a loop that continues multiplying `power` by `n` until it either matches `x` or exceeds it, ensuring that all potential powers are evaluated. Additionally, simplifying the return statement by using parentheses can enhance readability, aligning with common coding practices.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a logical error in the return statement, as it uses `!=` instead of `==`, which leads to incorrect results when checking if the number is a perfect cube. Additionally, while the use of `abs(a)` is appropriate for handling negative inputs, it may be beneficial to clarify the handling of negative cubes in the function's documentation. Lastly, consider using a more precise method for cube root calculation to avoid potential floating-point inaccuracies, although this is less critical given the context of integer inputs.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a logical flaw as it uses an infinite loop (`while True`) without a proper termination condition, which will cause it to run indefinitely.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code for checking prime numbers is efficient, particularly with the use of the 6k ± 1 optimization, but it could be simplified for readability and maintainability by using a straightforward approach similar to the correct code. Additionally, the existing `is_prime` function does not handle the case of zero-length strings, which is addressed in the correct code by explicitly checking for lengths of 0 and 1. Lastly, the correct code includes a docstring that enhances clarity and provides examples, which is a good practice for documentation that should be adopted in the existing code as well.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code uses ASCII values to perform character transformations, which can be less readable and harder to maintain compared to using a predefined string of the alphabet, as seen in the correct code. Additionally, the logic for calculating the new character position could be simplified by directly using string indexing, which enhances clarity and reduces the potential for off-by-one errors. Lastly, consider adding a docstring to the function to explain its purpose and behavior, improving code documentation for future reference.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code redundantly splits the input string by multiple delimiters ('.', '!', '?') in separate loops, which is inefficient; instead, consider using a single split operation with a regular expression to handle all delimiters at once. Additionally, the existing logic checks only the first character of each sentence, which may lead to incorrect results if there are leading spaces; ensure to check for the exact phrase "I " instead. Lastly, using a generator expression with `sum` can simplify the counting process, improving both readability and performance.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has several issues that could be improved for correctness and efficiency. First, the prime-checking function `isPrime` incorrectly checks for divisibility starting from 3 and uses `n % i == 1`, which is not a valid prime check; it should start from 2 and use `n % i == 0` to identify non-prime numbers. Additionally, the loop iterates over every other element in the list (using `i += 2`), which may skip potential prime candidates; instead, it should iterate through all elements (using `i += 1`) to ensure the largest prime is found.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code effectively checks if all dictionary keys are either lowercase or uppercase strings, but it could be simplified for clarity and efficiency. For example, instead of using two separate checks for lowercase and uppercase keys, you could maintain a single state variable to track the case type as you iterate through the keys, which would reduce redundancy and improve readability. Additionally, consider using more descriptive variable names and adding type hints to enhance code maintainability and clarity.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has several structural issues, including the absence of a loop to iterate through potential prime numbers and the undefined variable `i`, which will lead to runtime errors. Additionally, the use of a `while True` loop without a termination condition can result in an infinite loop, while the correct code effectively utilizes a `for` loop to iterate through the range of numbers and checks for primality. To improve the code, consider implementing a clear loop structure and defining the range of numbers to check for primes, ensuring that the logic aligns with the intended functionality of returning prime numbers less than `n`.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly checks if `m` is less than or equal to `n`, which allows for an invalid case where `n` equals `m` to proceed, potentially leading to confusion. Additionally, while the summation logic is correct, consider optimizing it by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series instead of iterating through each integer, which would enhance performance for larger ranges. Lastly, ensure that the function's documentation clearly states the expected behavior for edge cases, such as when `n` equals `m`.

The @@Existing Code has a few key issues that could be improved: first, the dictionary uses floating-point keys instead of integers, which could lead to unexpected behavior when trying to access values; second, the sorting function incorrectly uses `reverse=1.0` instead of `reverse=True`, which is the correct boolean flag; and finally, the code does not filter the input array to only include integers between 1 and 9 before sorting, which is necessary to meet the specified requirements.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly implements the logic for odd indices; it calculates the factorial instead of the sum of numbers from 1 to i, which leads to incorrect results. Additionally, the code redundantly computes the factorial for both even and odd indices, which can be optimized by separating the logic for even and odd cases more clearly.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a logical error in the handling of the empty array case, where it incorrectly returns `False` instead of `True`, as specified in the requirements. Additionally, the return statement within the loop should return `False` when the arrays do not match, rather than `True`, which contradicts the intended functionality of checking for a sorted arrangement. To improve clarity and efficiency, consider eliminating the unnecessary creation of `my_arr` by directly comparing the sorted array with the possible right-shifted versions of the original array.

The @@Existing Code has several inefficiencies, particularly in its use of `list.count()`, which iterates through the list multiple times, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2).

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code lacks the logic to calculate the total number of times buckets need to be lowered, as it only contains a `return sum()` statement without any computation. In contrast, the correct code effectively uses a list comprehension to iterate through each row of the grid, summing the water units and dividing by the bucket capacity, applying `math.ceil` to ensure that partial buckets are counted as full lowers. To improve the existing code, you should implement a similar approach to accurately compute the total number of bucket lowers needed for the given grid and capacity.

The existing code has a couple of issues: first, it incorrectly uses `2.0` instead of `2` in the `bin()` function, which will raise a TypeError; second, the double sorting (`sorted(sorted(arr))`) is unnecessary and inefficient, as it sorts the array twice instead of once based on the required criteria.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code only checks for numbers between 10 and 99, which excludes single-digit numbers, while the correct code includes all numbers with at most two digits. Additionally, the correct code utilizes a generator expression within the `sum` function for a more concise and efficient calculation. To enhance readability and maintainability, consider adding a docstring to explain the function's purpose and constraints, similar to the correct code.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains several issues, such as incorrect usage of the `strip()` method with an argument, which should not be the case, and improper handling of the `split()` method that uses incorrect delimiters. Additionally, the conversion of month, day, and year to integers uses invalid bases, which will lead to errors. To improve the code, ensure that string manipulations are correctly applied, validate the date format before parsing, and consider using a more robust date validation approach, such as leveraging Python's built-in date handling libraries.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code checks if a list is sorted and contains no duplicates, but it incorrectly allows for multiple occurrences of the same number, which contradicts the requirement of allowing only one duplicate. Additionally, the use of `len(set(lst))` to check for duplicates is inefficient since it requires creating a new set, and the comparison `lst == sorted(lst)` can be optimized by checking the order in a single pass. Instead, consider implementing a counting mechanism for duplicates and a single traversal to verify the sorted order, which would enhance both clarity and performance.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a few key issues: the `is_prime` function does not handle the cases for 0 and 1 correctly, and it uses an inefficient prime-checking algorithm that checks all numbers up to `num`, rather than up to the square root. Additionally, the logic for calculating the intersection length is slightly off, as it should not include the endpoints when determining if the length is prime, which is addressed in the correct code.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly calculates the product of signs by subtracting one from the count of non-positive numbers, which can lead to incorrect results, especially when the count is zero. Instead, it should directly count the negative numbers to determine the sign product, as shown in the correct code. Additionally, consider using a generator expression instead of `list(filter(...))` for better performance and readability when counting negative numbers.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains several logical errors and inefficiencies that could lead to incorrect results. First, the initialization of `val` is incorrect; it should be set to a value that is guaranteed to be larger than any possible grid value, such as `n * n + 1`, instead of `(n + n) / 1`. Additionally, the indexing for neighbor cells is incorrect; you should use `i - 1`, `j - 1`, `i + 1`, and `j + 1` to access neighboring cells, rather than using division and multiplication by 1. Lastly, the condition for appending to `ans` should be based on the index modulo 2 rather than a fixed condition of `i - 2 == 0`, which does not correctly alternate values.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a recursive approach with memoization, which can lead to inefficiencies and stack overflow for larger values of `n` due to deep recursion, while the correct code uses an iterative approach that is more efficient and avoids these issues. Additionally, the existing code incorrectly computes the Tribonacci sequence for odd values, as it uses `n + 1` instead of the correct formula, which should involve the previous two computed values. Lastly, the existing code does not handle the case when `n` is zero, while the correct code explicitly returns the appropriate list for that scenario.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a logical flaw in its condition for determining if the last character is a letter; it uses an `or` operator instead of `and`, which could lead to incorrect results when the last character is not a single letter. Additionally, the code could benefit from using the `str.isalpha()` method for clarity and readability, as it directly checks if a character is alphabetical without needing to convert it to lowercase or check ASCII values. Lastly, consider handling cases where the input string may have trailing spaces more robustly, as this could affect the outcome of the split operation.

The existing code correctly identifies the largest index where an element is less than its predecessor, but it lacks clarity and documentation, which can make it difficult for others (or even the original author) to understand its purpose and functionality. Additionally, using a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop can improve readability and maintainability, as the `for` loop is more idiomatic for iterating over a range of indices. Lastly, consider adding a docstring to explain the function's purpose, expected input, and output, which enhances code documentation and usability.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a critical logical error in the condition that checks for the number of digits in the filename; it incorrectly allows three digits instead of disallowing them, as specified in the requirements. Additionally, the return statement for the case where the file does not contain exactly one dot should return 'No' instead of 'Yes', aligning with the intended validation logic. Lastly, consider using more descriptive variable names to enhance code readability and maintainability.

The existing code has several issues that need addressing: first, the `range()` function is missing an argument, which will lead to an error; it should specify the length of the list to iterate over. Additionally, the `append` method is incorrectly used with multiple arguments, which should instead be a single value, and the final return statement should sum the `result` list rather than using `sum()` without arguments.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a logical discrepancy in the condition for checking the sum of the triples, as it uses a modulo of 2 instead of the required 3, which is crucial for meeting the problem's requirements. Additionally, the use of a list to store valid triples is inefficient; instead, consider maintaining a count of valid combinations directly to optimize memory usage and performance. Lastly, the triple nested loop can be improved by leveraging combinatorial mathematics to reduce the time complexity, especially for larger values of `n`.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a couple of issues that can be improved for correctness and clarity. Firstly, the slicing logic should include the planets immediately adjacent to `planet1` and `planet2`, which means the indices should be adjusted to `+1` instead of `+2`, ensuring that the planets directly next to the input planets are included in the result. Additionally, returning a tuple explicitly is important for clarity, as the current implementation returns a list, which could lead to confusion regarding the expected output type.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a logical flaw in the strength calculation, as it does not account for the requirement that the strength should be calculated as a fraction (CAP - SM) rather than a simple difference, potentially leading to incorrect results. Additionally, using `extensions.index(x)` in the `max` function can be inefficient, especially for larger lists, since it requires a linear search for each element; instead, a single pass through the list to determine the strongest extension would be more optimal. Lastly, adding a docstring to explain the function's purpose and parameters would enhance readability and maintainability.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly checks for the presence of rotations of string `b` in string `a` by using the `find` method on the concatenated string `rotated_b`, which will not yield the correct results since it checks for the entire concatenated string rather than individual rotations. Instead, consider implementing a more direct comparison approach, as seen in the correct code, where you iterate through possible starting points in `a` and compare substrings directly against the possible rotations of `b`. Additionally, the existing code could benefit from improved readability by using meaningful variable names and comments to clarify the logic behind the substring checks.

To improve the code, ensure that the total eaten carrots are correctly calculated by adding the number of carrots eaten to the existing count, and accurately reflect the remaining carrots after consumption.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a critical issue in how it constructs the expression string; it incorrectly multiplies the operator by the operand string instead of concatenating them, which will lead to unexpected results. Additionally, using `eval` poses security risks, especially if the input is not strictly controlled, so consider alternative methods for evaluating expressions safely.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a logical flaw in the handling of the `flg` variable, which should be set to `1` when a letter is found, indicating that the string contains letters; however, it is incorrectly set to `0`. Additionally, the method of constructing the new string by appending characters in a loop can be optimized by using a list comprehension or the `join` method for better performance and readability. Lastly, the final string reversal logic could be simplified by directly checking the `flg` variable before deciding whether to reverse the string or return it as is.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly returns the result of adding 1.0 to the input number instead of extracting the decimal part, which leads to a misunderstanding of the function's purpose. To improve this, focus on using a mathematical operation that isolates the decimal portion, such as the modulus operator, which is correctly employed in the correct code. Additionally, ensure that the function's documentation accurately reflects its behavior, as the current docstring does not align with the implementation.

The existing code has a few issues: it does not handle cases where parentheses are unbalanced, which could lead to incorrect depth calculations, and it does not properly separate the parsing of individual groups of parentheses, leading to a less modular design. The correct code addresses these concerns by introducing a helper function that encapsulates the logic for calculating the maximum depth of a single group, enhancing readability and maintainability.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The primary issue in the @@Existing Code is the incorrect use of the division operator (`/`) instead of the concatenation operator (`+`) when returning the final palindrome string, which will lead to a runtime error. Additionally, while the logic for finding the longest palindromic suffix is sound, consider optimizing the palindrome check by potentially caching results or using a more efficient algorithm to reduce the number of checks performed, especially for longer strings. Lastly, ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as strings with special characters or varying cases, to enhance robustness.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a couple of issues that can be improved for clarity and functionality. Firstly, the `zip` function is incorrectly called with additional arguments (77 and 37), which are unnecessary and will cause a TypeError; it should only take the two input strings. Additionally, the `xor` function is not being used correctly in the `join` method, as it requires both elements from the zipped pairs, so ensure that both `x` and `y` are passed to the `xor` function for accurate binary XOR computation.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly counts occurrences of the substring by incrementing the `times` variable when the substring is not found, rather than when it is found. Additionally, the expected results in the docstring for the test cases are inaccurate; for instance, the count for 'aaa' with 'a' should be 3, not 2, as it includes overlapping instances.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code lacks the implementation for sorting the numbers, as it only returns an empty string without processing the input.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code efficiently sorts the list and finds the closest elements in a single pass, which is optimal in terms of time complexity, while the @@Correct Code employs a nested loop that results in a higher time complexity, making it less efficient for larger lists. Additionally, the @@Existing Code initializes `closest_pair` with infinity, which is a clearer way to represent an uninitialized state compared to the @@Correct Code's use of `None`. To improve clarity and maintainability, consider using meaningful variable names and ensuring that the logic for finding the closest pair is both efficient and straightforward.

The existing code incorrectly computes the rescaled values by dividing by `max_number` instead of `max_number - min_number`, which means it does not properly normalize the values between 0 and 1.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly uses a `for` loop with a fixed range of 5, which limits the factorization to only small integers and does not account for larger values of `n`. Instead, a `while` loop should be employed that continues until `i` exceeds the square root of `n`, allowing for a complete factorization of larger numbers. Additionally, the increment of `i` should only occur when a factor is not found, ensuring that all factors are considered correctly.

The existing code incorrectly retains elements that occur twice, while the correct code specifies that only elements that occur once should be kept. To align with the intended functionality, you should adjust the condition in the list comprehension to filter out any element that appears more than once, rather than allowing those that appear twice. Additionally, consider the efficiency of using `collections.Counter` for counting occurrences, as it may be beneficial to explore alternatives if performance becomes an issue with larger datasets.

Additionally, the loop can be optimized by iterating only up to the square root of `n` instead of `n - 1`, which would improve performance for larger numbers.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a logical error in the conditions of the while loops within the `find_zero` function; using `>=` instead of `>` could lead to an infinite loop if the polynomial evaluates to zero at either `begin` or `end`.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly uses `3.0` as the step in the slicing operation, which leads to a TypeError since slice steps must be integers; using `3` instead will resolve this issue. Additionally, consider the implications of modifying the original list in place versus creating a new one, as this could affect the function's behavior if the input list is expected to remain unchanged. Lastly, ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as empty lists or lists with fewer than three elements, to enhance robustness.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a couple of key issues compared to the correct version. First, the group splitting logic in the `encode_cyclic` function should use `(len(s) + 2) // 3` to ensure all characters are included in the last group, especially when the string length is not a multiple of three. Additionally, the cycling logic should shift the characters correctly by moving the first character to the end, which is done by `(group[1:] + group[0])` instead of the current approach, which incorrectly shifts the last two characters to the front. Lastly, the `decode_cyclic` function should call the encoding function twice to reverse the encoding process, ensuring that the original string is accurately restored.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly checks for a sum of one instead of zero, which is a fundamental misunderstanding of the function's purpose. Additionally, the triple nested loop approach can be inefficient for larger lists; consider using a more optimal algorithm, such as sorting the list and using a two-pointer technique, to reduce time complexity. Lastly, ensure that the function's documentation accurately reflects its functionality to avoid confusion for future users.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains an infinite loop due to the absence of a loop control variable, which prevents it from iterating through the string properly; using a `for` loop, as shown in the correct code, is a more effective approach. Additionally, the existing code does not handle the case where the length of the string exceeds the index range, which could lead to an `IndexError`. Finally, consider optimizing the palindrome check by only iterating halfway through the string, as checking beyond the midpoint is unnecessary.

The existing code incorrectly multiplies `ret` by 3 instead of 2, which leads to incorrect results for the intended calculation of \(2^n \mod p\).

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a critical error in the logic for handling closing brackets, where it incorrectly increments the `depth` instead of decrementing it, which will lead to incorrect results for inputs with unmatched brackets. To improve the code, ensure that the decrement operation accurately reflects the closing of an opening bracket, as this is essential for correctly tracking the balance of brackets. Additionally, consider adding input validation to handle unexpected characters, which would enhance the robustness of the function.

The existing code has several issues: it incorrectly uses `1.0` and `0.0` instead of `True` and `False`, which can lead to confusion since the function is expected to return boolean values. Additionally, the use of `reverse=1.0` is incorrect; it should be `reverse=True` for clarity and correctness.

The existing code contains several issues: it incorrectly initializes the set with a number (80) instead of an empty set, and it fails to add the common elements correctly, as the `add()` method is called without an argument. Additionally, the final return statement attempts to sort an empty call instead of converting the set to a list first, which would lead to errors.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has several issues, primarily related to the use of floating-point numbers instead of integers, which can lead to unexpected behavior and inefficiencies. Additionally, the `is_prime` function should return boolean values (`True` or `False`) instead of `1.0` and `0.0`, improving readability and aligning with Python conventions. Lastly, the range in the `is_prime` function can be optimized by checking up to the square root of `k`, reducing the number of iterations needed for larger numbers.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly handles the base cases for `fibfib(1)`, returning 1 instead of 0, and it also uses an iterative approach that may not be necessary given the recursive definition of the sequence. Additionally, the iterative method can lead to inefficiencies for larger values of `n`, while a recursive approach, despite its own drawbacks, aligns better with the mathematical definition provided. Finally, consider adding memoization to the recursive solution to optimize performance and avoid redundant calculations.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a logical error in the initial value of the `switch` variable; it should start as `True` to correctly alternate between selecting the minimum and maximum values. Additionally, using `remove` on the list can lead to inefficiencies, especially with larger lists, as it requires searching for the item to remove each time; consider using a different approach to manage the list. Lastly, consider the implications of modifying the input list directly, as it may lead to unintended side effects if the original list is needed later.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a critical error in the area calculation, where the exponent should be 0.5 (for square root) instead of 0, which results in an incorrect area value. Additionally, the rounding function should take an integer as the second argument, so using `round(area, 2)` instead of `round(area, 2.0)` is more appropriate.

The existing code has logical errors in both the weight comparison and the palindrome check: it incorrectly uses `>=` instead of `>` for the weight comparison and checks for equality (`==`) instead of inequality (`!=`) for the palindrome condition.

The existing code for `is_multiply_prime` only counts the number of distinct prime factors of `a`, which does not ensure that `a` is the product of exactly three primes; it could mistakenly return `True` for numbers with more than three prime factors. The correct approach involves generating all combinations of three primes and checking if their product equals `a`, which guarantees that the function accurately identifies the multiplication of exactly three prime numbers. Additionally, the prime-checking function could be optimized to avoid unnecessary checks beyond the square root of `n`, similar to the approach in the existing code.

def hex_key(num):
    """You have been tasked to write a function that receives 
    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal 
    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number 
    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).
    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...
    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, 
    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).
    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, 
    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.

    For num = "1077E" the output should be 2.
    For num = "ABED1A33" the output should be 4.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a logical flaw as it uses an infinite loop (`while True`) without a proper termination condition, which will cause it to run indefinitely. Additionally, the method of checking for prime hexadecimal digits is inefficient; using a `for` loop with an index to iterate through the string would be more appropriate and clear. Lastly, consider using a set for the `primes` variable for faster membership testing, which can enhance performance when checking if a digit is prime.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly slices the binary string returned by the `bin()` function, starting from the third character (`[3:]`), which omits the '0b' prefix that indicates a binary number in Python; instead, it should start from the second character (`[2:]`) to include the full binary representation. Additionally, consider validating the input to ensure that only non-negative integers are processed, as negative numbers or non-integer types could lead to unexpected behavior.

The existing code redundantly splits the input string by multiple delimiters ('.', '!', '?') in separate loops, which is inefficient; instead, consider using a single split operation with a regular expression to handle all delimiters at once.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a critical issue in the `isinstance` checks, as it incorrectly uses `isinstance(int)` without specifying the variable being checked, which will always return `True`. Additionally, the logic for checking if one number equals the sum of the other two is correct, but it could be made more concise by combining the conditions into a single return statement. Lastly, consider adding type hints to the function signature to enhance clarity and improve code readability.

The existing code incorrectly replaces vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the alphabet, while the correct code specifies a shift of only two places instead of three.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has several issues that could be improved for correctness and efficiency. First, the prime-checking function `isPrime` incorrectly checks for divisibility starting from 3 and uses `n % i == 1`, which is not a valid prime check; it should start from 2 and use `n % i == 0` to identify non-prime numbers. Additionally, the loop iterates over every other element in the list (using `i += 2`), which may skip potential prime candidates; instead, it should iterate through all elements (using `i += 1`) to ensure the largest prime is found.

The @@Existing Code effectively checks if all dictionary keys are either lowercase or uppercase strings, but it could be simplified for clarity and efficiency.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not handle cases where the input is a string representation of a number that is exactly halfway between two integers (e.g., "14.5" or "-14.5"), which is a key requirement in the correct code. Additionally, the logic for determining the closest integer could be simplified by using built-in rounding functions, which would enhance readability and maintainability. Finally, the existing code lacks input validation, which could lead to errors if the input is not a valid numeric string, so incorporating checks for valid input would improve robustness.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly implements the logic for odd indices; it calculates the factorial instead of the sum of numbers from 1 to i, which leads to incorrect results. Additionally, the code redundantly computes the factorial for both even and odd indices, which can be optimized by separating the logic for even and odd cases more clearly. Lastly, using list concatenation with `+=` in each iteration can be less efficient than appending elements individually, so consider using the `append` method for better performance.

The existing code counts numbers based on the sum of their absolute digits, which does not align with the requirement to consider the signed nature of the first digit for negative numbers. To improve, you should implement a helper function that accurately computes the digit sum while accounting for the sign of the first digit, as shown in the correct code.

The existing code contains a logical error in the handling of the empty array case, where it incorrectly returns `False` instead of `True`, as specified in the requirements. Additionally, the return statement within the loop should return `False` when the arrays do not match, rather than `True`, which contradicts the intended functionality of checking for a sorted arrangement.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has several issues, including incorrect string formatting and a misunderstanding of how to construct the output message. Firstly, the phrase "the str{s}ng" should be corrected to "the str{n}ng" to reflect the count of odd digits, and similarly for the other instances where the count should replace the placeholder. Additionally, using a generator expression for counting odd digits can improve performance and readability, as it avoids creating an unnecessary list.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a logical flaw as it uses an infinite loop (`while True`) without iterating over the input array, which will lead to an error or infinite execution. Instead, you should utilize a `for` loop to iterate through each element in the `nums` array, ensuring that the sum is calculated correctly for each number. Additionally, consider renaming variables for clarity, such as changing `max_sum` to `max_negative_sum`, which would better reflect its purpose in finding the minimum sub-array sum.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code lacks the logic to calculate the total number of times buckets need to be lowered, as it only contains a `return sum()` statement without any computation. In contrast, the correct code effectively uses a list comprehension to iterate through each row of the grid, summing the water units and dividing by the bucket capacity, applying `math.ceil` to ensure that partial buckets are counted as full lowers. To improve the existing code, you should implement a similar approach to accurately compute the total number of bucket lowers needed for the given grid and capacity.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code sorts the array in descending order to obtain the maximum k numbers, which is inefficient since it requires a complete sort. Instead, consider sorting the array in ascending order and then slicing the last k elements, as this approach is more intuitive and leverages the sorted nature of the array.

    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined

    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code checks if a list is sorted and contains no duplicates, but it incorrectly allows for multiple occurrences of the same number, which contradicts the requirement of allowing only one duplicate. Additionally, the use of `len(set(lst))` to check for duplicates is inefficient since it requires creating a new set, and the comparison `lst == sorted(lst)` can be optimized by checking the order in a single pass. Instead, consider implementing a counting mechanism for duplicates and a single traversal to verify the sorted order, which would enhance both clarity and performance.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a few key issues: the `is_prime` function does not handle the cases for 0 and 1 correctly, and it uses an inefficient prime-checking algorithm that checks all numbers up to `num`, rather than up to the square root. Additionally, the logic for calculating the intersection length is slightly off, as it should not include the endpoints when determining if the length is prime, which is addressed in the correct code. To improve, consider refining the prime-checking logic for efficiency and ensuring the intersection length is calculated correctly according to the problem's requirements.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains several logical errors and inefficiencies that could lead to incorrect results. First, the initialization of `val` is incorrect; it should be set to a value that is guaranteed to be larger than any possible grid value, such as `n * n + 1`, instead of `(n + n) / 1`. Additionally, the indexing for neighbor cells is incorrect; you should use `i - 1`, `j - 1`, `i + 1`, and `j + 1` to access neighboring cells, rather than using division and multiplication by 1. Lastly, the condition for appending to `ans` should be based on the index modulo 2 rather than a fixed condition of `i - 2 == 0`, which does not correctly alternate values.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly initializes the `squared` variable to 1 instead of 0, which leads to an incorrect sum since it adds an extra 1 to the final result. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include type checks or validations for the elements in the list to ensure they are numeric, as this would enhance the robustness of the function. Lastly, consider using a list comprehension for calculating the squared values, as it can improve readability and potentially performance.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a logical flaw in its condition for determining if the last character is a letter; it uses an `or` operator instead of `and`, which could lead to incorrect results when the last character is not a single letter. Additionally, the code could benefit from using the `str.isalpha()` method for clarity and readability, as it directly checks if a character is alphabetical without needing to convert it to lowercase or check ASCII values. Lastly, consider handling cases where the input string may have trailing spaces more robustly, as this could affect the outcome of the split operation.

The existing code correctly identifies the largest index where an element is less than its predecessor, but it lacks clarity and documentation, which can make it difficult for others (or even the original author) to understand its purpose and functionality.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly uses `>=` instead of `>` when checking for consecutive spaces, which leads to improper handling of cases with exactly two spaces. Additionally, the logic for updating `start` and `end` could be simplified to improve readability and maintainability. Lastly, consider using a more efficient approach, such as regular expressions, to handle space replacements in a more concise manner.

The existing code has several issues that need addressing: first, the `range()` function is missing an argument, which will lead to an error; it should specify the length of the list to iterate over. Additionally, the `append` method is incorrectly used with multiple arguments, which should instead be a single value, and the final return statement should sum the `result` list rather than using `sum()` without arguments.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a logical discrepancy in the condition for checking the sum of the triples, as it uses a modulo of 2 instead of the required 3, which is crucial for meeting the problem's requirements. Additionally, the use of a list to store valid triples is inefficient; instead, consider maintaining a count of valid combinations directly to optimize memory usage and performance. Lastly, the triple nested loop can be improved by leveraging combinatorial mathematics to reduce the time complexity, especially for larger values of `n`.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a couple of issues that can be improved for correctness and clarity. Firstly, the slicing logic should include the planets immediately adjacent to `planet1` and `planet2`, which means the indices should be adjusted to `+1` instead of `+2`, ensuring that the planets directly next to the input planets are included in the result. Additionally, returning a tuple explicitly is important for clarity, as the current implementation returns a list, which could lead to confusion regarding the expected output type.

The @@Existing Code has a logical flaw in the strength calculation, as it does not account for the requirement that the strength should be calculated as a fraction (CAP - SM) rather than a simple difference, potentially leading to incorrect results. Additionally, using `extensions.index(x)` in the `max` function can be inefficient, especially for larger lists, since it requires a linear search for each element; instead, a single pass through the list to determine the strongest extension would be more optimal. Lastly, adding a docstring to explain the function's purpose and parameters would enhance readability and maintainability.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly checks for the presence of rotations of string `b` in string `a` by using the `find` method on the concatenated string `rotated_b`, which will not yield the correct results since it checks for the entire concatenated string rather than individual rotations. Instead, consider implementing a more direct comparison approach, as seen in the correct code, where you iterate through possible starting points in `a` and compare substrings directly against the possible rotations of `b`. Additionally, the existing code could benefit from improved readability by using meaningful variable names and comments to clarify the logic behind the substring checks.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains an infinite loop due to the use of `while True` without a termination condition, which will prevent it from executing correctly. Additionally, it fails to convert the input number into a string representation to iterate over its digits, and it does not handle negative numbers properly; using `abs(num)` in the correct code ensures that the function counts digits correctly regardless of the sign. To improve the code, consider implementing a loop that iterates over the digits of the absolute value of the input number, ensuring proper termination and accurate counting of even and odd digits.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a logical flaw in the handling of the `flg` variable, which should be set to `1` when a letter is found, indicating that the string contains letters; however, it is incorrectly set to `0`. Additionally, the method of constructing the new string by appending characters in a loop can be optimized by using a list comprehension or the `join` method for better performance and readability. Lastly, the final string reversal logic could be simplified by directly checking the `flg` variable before deciding whether to reverse the string or return it as is.

The existing code returns a string message for empty input, while the correct code returns `None`, which is more idiomatic in Python for indicating the absence of a value.

The existing code does not handle cases where the first argument is greater than the second, leading to an incorrect output when the range is reversed, such as in `generate_integers(8, 2)`. Additionally, the correct code specifies a range between 2 and 8, which limits the output to a specific set of even integers, while the existing code allows for any range defined by `a` and `b`, potentially leading to unexpected results.

The existing code incorrectly calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) by dividing the sum of absolute differences by `(len(numbers) - 1)` instead of `len(numbers)`, which is appropriate for calculating the average deviation from the mean. This adjustment is crucial because MAD should reflect the average deviation of all data points, not just a sample. Additionally, consider adding input validation to handle edge cases, such as empty lists, which could lead to division by zero errors.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains an infinite loop due to the `while True:` statement, which prevents it from processing the elements of the input list correctly; instead, consider using a loop that iterates through the elements of the list. Additionally, the variable `n` is not defined in the existing code, leading to a potential error when trying to append it to the result list. Lastly, the @@Correct Code effectively utilizes slicing to avoid adding the delimiter after the last element, which enhances clarity and prevents unnecessary operations.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a few issues: it does not handle cases where parentheses are unbalanced, which could lead to incorrect depth calculations, and it does not properly separate the parsing of individual groups of parentheses, leading to a less modular design. The correct code addresses these concerns by introducing a helper function that encapsulates the logic for calculating the maximum depth of a single group, enhancing readability and maintainability. Additionally, the correct code ensures that only non-empty groups are processed, preventing unnecessary calculations and potential errors.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a logical error in the while loop, as it references an undefined variable `s`, which will lead to a runtime error. Instead, using a for loop to iterate through the strings allows you to check each string's length against `maxlen` directly, ensuring that you return the first longest string correctly. Additionally, consider adding type hints for better clarity and maintainability, as they can help other developers understand the expected input and output types.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code efficiently sorts the list and finds the closest elements in a single pass, which is optimal in terms of time complexity, while the @@Correct Code employs a nested loop that results in a higher time complexity, making it less efficient for larger lists. Additionally, the @@Existing Code initializes `closest_pair` with infinity, which is a clearer way to represent an uninitialized state compared to the @@Correct Code's use of `None`. To improve clarity and maintainability, consider using meaningful variable names and ensuring that the logic for finding the closest pair is both efficient and straightforward.

The existing code incorrectly computes the rescaled values by dividing by `max_number` instead of `max_number - min_number`, which means it does not properly normalize the values between 0 and 1. This oversight can lead to incorrect results, especially when the range of the input list is not 1.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly replaces 'H' with 'h' after using `swapcase()`, which alters the intended output for the example provided in the docstring. To align with the correct code, focus on ensuring that the `swapcase()` method is used alone to achieve the desired case flipping without additional replacements. Additionally, consider enhancing the docstring to clarify the expected behavior, especially for edge cases or different input scenarios.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a few key issues: it incorrectly uses floating-point numbers (e.g., `2.0`, `0.0`, and `1.0`) instead of integers, which can lead to unexpected behavior, and it returns numeric values instead of boolean values, which does not align with the intended functionality of the function. Additionally, the loop can be optimized by iterating only up to the square root of `n` instead of `n - 1`, which would improve performance for larger numbers. Lastly, consider adding input validation to handle non-integer inputs gracefully, ensuring the function behaves predictably across a wider range of inputs.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a logical error where the variable `e` is referenced without being defined, which will lead to a runtime error. Additionally, the use of a `while True` loop is inappropriate here; instead, a `for` loop should be employed to iterate through the list elements, which enhances readability and efficiency. Lastly, consider adding a check for an empty list at the beginning to handle potential edge cases gracefully.

The existing code contains several issues, including an incomplete `range()` function call and incorrect usage of `append()` and `map()`, which lead to syntax errors and incorrect logic. To improve the code, ensure that the `range()` function correctly takes `n` as an argument, and simplify the `append()` and `map()` calls to properly convert the list of integers to strings without additional parameters. Additionally, consider using a generator expression for counting occurrences of '7', which can enhance readability and efficiency.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a couple of key issues compared to the correct version. First, the group splitting logic in the `encode_cyclic` function should use `(len(s) + 2) // 3` to ensure all characters are included in the last group, especially when the string length is not a multiple of three. Additionally, the cycling logic should shift the characters correctly by moving the first character to the end, which is done by `(group[1:] + group[0])` instead of the current approach, which incorrectly shifts the last two characters to the front. Lastly, the `decode_cyclic` function should call the encoding function twice to reverse the encoding process, ensuring that the original string is accurately restored.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly shifts characters by 4 instead of the intended 5, which leads to mismatched encoding and decoding processes. Additionally, the decoding function should adjust the shift to 5 instead of 4 to correctly reverse the encoding. To enhance clarity and maintainability, consider adding input validation to ensure that the function only processes alphabetic characters, which would prevent potential errors with non-alphabetic inputs.

The existing code incorrectly includes 'y' as a vowel, which is not universally accepted as a vowel in all contexts, potentially leading to unexpected results.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a critical error in the logic for handling closing brackets, where it incorrectly increments the `depth` instead of decrementing it, which will lead to incorrect results for inputs with unmatched brackets. To improve the code, ensure that the decrement operation accurately reflects the closing of an opening bracket, as this is essential for correctly tracking the balance of brackets. Additionally, consider adding input validation to handle unexpected characters, which would enhance the robustness of the function.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:
    check(correct_bracketing)

The existing code has several issues: it incorrectly uses `1.0` and `0.0` instead of `True` and `False`, which can lead to confusion since the function is expected to return boolean values. Additionally, the use of `reverse=1.0` is incorrect; it should be `reverse=True` for clarity and correctness. Lastly, consider optimizing the comparison by using a single pass through the list to check for monotonicity instead of sorting, which can improve performance for larger lists.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains several issues: it incorrectly initializes the set with a number (80) instead of an empty set, and it fails to add the common elements correctly, as the `add()` method is called without an argument. Additionally, the final return statement attempts to sort an empty call instead of converting the set to a list first, which would lead to errors. To improve the code, ensure that the set is initialized properly, add the common elements correctly, and convert the set to a list before sorting it for the final output.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has several issues, primarily related to the use of floating-point numbers instead of integers, which can lead to unexpected behavior and inefficiencies. Additionally, the `is_prime` function should return boolean values (`True` or `False`) instead of `1.0` and `0.0`, improving readability and aligning with Python conventions. Lastly, the range in the `is_prime` function can be optimized by checking up to the square root of `k`, reducing the number of iterations needed for larger numbers.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly uses `>=` instead of `>` in the condition that checks if the shift is greater than the number of digits, which could lead to unintended behavior when the shift equals the length of the string. Additionally, consider adding input validation to ensure that `x` is a non-negative integer and `shift` is a non-negative integer, as this would enhance the robustness of the function. Finally, documenting edge cases, such as what happens when `shift` is zero, would improve the clarity of the function's intended behavior.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has logical errors in both the weight comparison and the palindrome check: it incorrectly uses `>=` instead of `>` for the weight comparison and checks for equality (`==`) instead of inequality (`!=`) for the palindrome condition. Additionally, the palindrome check could be optimized by using a single loop or leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for checking palindromes, which would enhance readability and efficiency. Lastly, consider adding input validation to ensure that `q` is a list of numbers, which would make the function more robust.

The existing code has a few issues that can be improved for clarity and correctness. First, the use of floating-point numbers (e.g., `0.0` and `// 2.0`) for indexing and counting is unnecessary and can lead to confusion; using integers is more appropriate. Additionally, the variable `ans` should be initialized as an integer (e.g., `0`) instead of a float, as it is intended to count the number of changes needed, which should always be a whole number.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code for `is_multiply_prime` only counts the number of distinct prime factors of `a`, which does not ensure that `a` is the product of exactly three primes; it could mistakenly return `True` for numbers with more than three prime factors. The correct approach involves generating all combinations of three primes and checking if their product equals `a`, which guarantees that the function accurately identifies the multiplication of exactly three prime numbers. Additionally, the prime-checking function could be optimized to avoid unnecessary checks beyond the square root of `n`, similar to the approach in the existing code.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly slices the binary string returned by the `bin()` function, starting from the third character (`[3:]`), which omits the '0b' prefix that indicates a binary number in Python; instead, it should start from the second character (`[2:]`) to include the full binary representation. Additionally, consider validating the input to ensure that only non-negative integers are processed, as negative numbers or non-integer types could lead to unexpected behavior. Finally, adding type hints to the function signature could improve code readability and maintainability by clearly indicating the expected input and output types.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a few issues, such as using floating-point numbers (e.g., `3.0`, `0.0`) instead of integers, which can lead to unexpected behavior since string lengths and indices should be handled as integers. Additionally, the return values should be boolean (`True` or `False`) rather than numeric (`1.0` or `0.0`), as this aligns better with the function's purpose of checking a condition. Lastly, the formatting of the code could be improved for better readability, such as consistent indentation and spacing around operators.

The existing code has a minor inconsistency in the test output, where it incorrectly outputs 'B' instead of 'C' for the GPA of 3.0; this suggests a misunderstanding of the grading logic.

The existing code for checking prime numbers is efficient, particularly with the use of the 6k ± 1 optimization, but it could be simplified for readability and maintainability by using a straightforward approach similar to the correct code.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains several issues, including incorrect usage of the `sorted` function and unnecessary parameters that do not align with its intended functionality. Specifically, the `list(i, 95)` and `sorted(list(i, 74), 4)` calls are not valid and will lead to errors, as they do not conform to the expected input types for these functions. To improve the code, focus on simplifying the sorting logic by directly applying `sorted` to each word without extraneous parameters, ensuring clarity and correctness in the implementation.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

The existing code uses ASCII values to perform character transformations, which can be less readable and harder to maintain compared to using a predefined string of the alphabet, as seen in the correct code.

The existing code redundantly splits the input string by multiple delimiters ('.', '!', '?') in separate loops, which is inefficient; instead, consider using a single split operation with a regular expression to handle all delimiters at once.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly replaces vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the alphabet, while the correct code specifies a shift of only two places instead of three. Additionally, the use of a dictionary comprehension for vowel replacement is efficient, but consider using a more explicit loop for clarity, especially for those less familiar with Python's dictionary comprehensions. Lastly, ensure that the function's documentation accurately reflects the behavior of the code, particularly regarding the vowel replacement logic.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has several issues that could be improved for correctness and efficiency. First, the prime-checking function `isPrime` incorrectly checks for divisibility starting from 3 and uses `n % i == 1`, which is not a valid prime check; it should start from 2 and use `n % i == 0` to identify non-prime numbers. Additionally, the loop iterates over every other element in the list (using `i += 2`), which may skip potential prime candidates; instead, it should iterate through all elements (using `i += 1`) to ensure the largest prime is found.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code effectively checks if all dictionary keys are either lowercase or uppercase strings, but it could be simplified for clarity and efficiency. For example, instead of using two separate checks for lowercase and uppercase keys, you could maintain a single state variable to track the case type as you iterate through the keys, which would reduce redundancy and improve readability. Additionally, consider using more descriptive variable names and adding type hints to enhance code maintainability and clarity.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has several structural issues, including the absence of a loop to iterate through potential prime numbers and the undefined variable `i`, which will lead to runtime errors. Additionally, the use of a `while True` loop without a termination condition can result in an infinite loop, while the correct code effectively utilizes a `for` loop to iterate through the range of numbers and checks for primality. To improve the code, consider implementing a clear loop structure and defining the range of numbers to check for primes, ensuring that the logic aligns with the intended functionality of returning prime numbers less than `n`.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code is more complex than necessary, using a loop and conditional logic to determine the number of stones at each level, whereas the correct code employs a straightforward list comprehension that directly calculates the required values. This not only simplifies the logic but also enhances readability and performance by eliminating unnecessary variable assignments and iterations. Additionally, the correct code includes a docstring that clarifies the function's purpose and usage, which is a best practice for maintainability and usability.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly implements the logic for odd indices; it calculates the factorial instead of the sum of numbers from 1 to i, which leads to incorrect results. Additionally, the code redundantly computes the factorial for both even and odd indices, which can be optimized by separating the logic for even and odd cases more clearly.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains several issues, including incorrect function parameters and logic errors in the palindrome check and the loop range. Specifically, the `is_palindrome` function incorrectly attempts to use parameters that are not defined, and the loop only iterates from 0 instead of the intended range of 1 to `n`. To improve the code, ensure that the loop iterates correctly over the specified range and that the palindrome check is accurately implemented without extraneous parameters.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code counts numbers based on the sum of their absolute digits, which does not align with the requirement to consider the signed nature of the first digit for negative numbers. To improve, you should implement a helper function that accurately computes the digit sum while accounting for the sign of the first digit, as shown in the correct code. Additionally, consider using built-in functions like `filter` and `len` for cleaner and more efficient counting of valid elements, rather than manually iterating and incrementing a counter.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a logical error in the handling of the empty array case, where it incorrectly returns `False` instead of `True`, as specified in the requirements. Additionally, the return statement within the loop should return `False` when the arrays do not match, rather than `True`, which contradicts the intended functionality of checking for a sorted arrangement. To improve clarity and efficiency, consider eliminating the unnecessary creation of `my_arr` by directly comparing the sorted array with the possible right-shifted versions of the original array.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a logical flaw as it uses an infinite loop (`while True`) without iterating over the input array, which will lead to an error or infinite execution. Instead, you should utilize a `for` loop to iterate through each element in the `nums` array, ensuring that the sum is calculated correctly for each number. Additionally, consider renaming variables for clarity, such as changing `max_sum` to `max_negative_sum`, which would better reflect its purpose in finding the minimum sub-array sum.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code lacks the logic to calculate the total number of times buckets need to be lowered, as it only contains a `return sum()` statement without any computation. In contrast, the correct code effectively uses a list comprehension to iterate through each row of the grid, summing the water units and dividing by the bucket capacity, applying `math.ceil` to ensure that partial buckets are counted as full lowers. To improve the existing code, you should implement a similar approach to accurately compute the total number of bucket lowers needed for the given grid and capacity.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly identifies the positions of elements, as it starts counting from index 1 (the second element) instead of index 0 (the first element), which leads to summing odd numbers in odd positions rather than even ones. Additionally, using a generator expression is less clear than using `enumerate`, which improves readability and allows for more straightforward condition checks on both index and value. Lastly, the existing code lacks a docstring, which is essential for explaining the function's purpose and usage, enhancing maintainability and usability.

def get_odd_collatz(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

    For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains logical errors in the handling of the Collatz sequence, particularly in the conditions for determining odd and even numbers, which should be based on `n % 2` instead of `n % 3`. Additionally, the loop should continue until `n` is greater than 1, not 2, to ensure that the sequence includes the final term of 1.

The @@Existing Code contains several issues, such as incorrect usage of the `strip()` method with an argument, which should not be the case, and improper handling of the `split()` method that uses incorrect delimiters. Additionally, the conversion of month, day, and year to integers uses invalid bases, which will lead to errors.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code checks if a list is sorted and contains no duplicates, but it incorrectly allows for multiple occurrences of the same number, which contradicts the requirement of allowing only one duplicate. Additionally, the use of `len(set(lst))` to check for duplicates is inefficient since it requires creating a new set, and the comparison `lst == sorted(lst)` can be optimized by checking the order in a single pass. Instead, consider implementing a counting mechanism for duplicates and a single traversal to verify the sorted order, which would enhance both clarity and performance.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a few key issues: the `is_prime` function does not handle the cases for 0 and 1 correctly, and it uses an inefficient prime-checking algorithm that checks all numbers up to `num`, rather than up to the square root. Additionally, the logic for calculating the intersection length is slightly off, as it should not include the endpoints when determining if the length is prime, which is addressed in the correct code. To improve, consider refining the prime-checking logic for efficiency and ensuring the intersection length is calculated correctly according to the problem's requirements.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly calculates the product of signs by subtracting one from the count of non-positive numbers, which can lead to incorrect results, especially when the count is zero. Instead, it should directly count the negative numbers to determine the sign product, as shown in the correct code. Additionally, consider using a generator expression instead of `list(filter(...))` for better performance and readability when counting negative numbers.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains several logical errors and inefficiencies that could lead to incorrect results. First, the initialization of `val` is incorrect; it should be set to a value that is guaranteed to be larger than any possible grid value, such as `n * n + 1`, instead of `(n + n) / 1`. Additionally, the indexing for neighbor cells is incorrect; you should use `i - 1`, `j - 1`, `i + 1`, and `j + 1` to access neighboring cells, rather than using division and multiplication by 1. Lastly, the condition for appending to `ans` should be based on the index modulo 2 rather than a fixed condition of `i - 2 == 0`, which does not correctly alternate values.

The existing code contains a recursive approach with memoization, which can lead to inefficiencies and stack overflow for larger values of `n` due to deep recursion, while the correct code uses an iterative approach that is more efficient and avoids these issues. Additionally, the existing code incorrectly computes the Tribonacci sequence for odd values, as it uses `n + 1` instead of the correct formula, which should involve the previous two computed values.

The existing code incorrectly checks for even digits instead of odd ones, which fundamentally alters its intended functionality; you should modify the condition to check for odd digits. Additionally, consider initializing the product to 0 instead of 1, as this would allow the function to return 0 immediately if there are no odd digits, simplifying the logic.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a logical flaw in its condition for determining if the last character is a letter; it uses an `or` operator instead of `and`, which could lead to incorrect results when the last character is not a single letter. Additionally, the code could benefit from using the `str.isalpha()` method for clarity and readability, as it directly checks if a character is alphabetical without needing to convert it to lowercase or check ASCII values. Lastly, consider handling cases where the input string may have trailing spaces more robustly, as this could affect the outcome of the split operation.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code correctly identifies the largest index where an element is less than its predecessor, but it lacks clarity and documentation, which can make it difficult for others (or even the original author) to understand its purpose and functionality. Additionally, using a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop can improve readability and maintainability, as the `for` loop is more idiomatic for iterating over a range of indices. Lastly, consider adding a docstring to explain the function's purpose, expected input, and output, which enhances code documentation and usability.
