Please fix it.\nThe existing code contains incorrect base cases for the Fibonacci sequence, as it returns 2 for `n == 2` instead of 1, and it incorrectly uses `fib(n - 3)` instead of `fib(n - 2)`, leading to incorrect results for higher values of `n`. To improve the code, ensure that the base cases correctly reflect the Fibonacci sequence, starting with `fib(0) = 0` and `fib(1) = 1`, and adjust the recursive calls to follow the correct Fibonacci definition. Additionally, consider implementing memoization or an iterative approach to optimize performance and avoid excessive recursion, especially for larger values of `n`.\nHere is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:\n    check(fib)\ntest_mut.py:22: in check\n    assert candidate(10) == 55\ntest_mut.py:14: in fib\n    return fib(n -

Instead of using a generator expression with `all()`, you could simplify the integer check by using `isinstance()` directly for each variable, which makes the code more readable. Additionally, the return statements could be streamlined to reduce redundancy, as the final return of `False` is already covered by the preceding conditions.\nHere is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:\n[WinError 2] 系统找不到指定的文件。\n[]", "isTrue": false}]}], "test": "def check(candidate):\n\n    # Check some simple cases\n    assert candidate(2, 3, 1)==True, \"This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)\"\n    assert candidate(2.5, 2, 3)==False, \"This prints if this assert fails 2 (good for debugging!)\"\n    assert candidate(1.5, 5, 3.5)==False, \"This prints if this assert fails 3 (good for debugging!)\"\n    assert candidate(2, 6, 2)==False, \"This prints if this assert fails 4 (good for debugging!)\"\n    assert candidate(4, 2, 2)==True, \"This prints if this assert fails 5 (good for debugging!)\"\n    assert candidate(2.2, 2.2, 2.2)==False, \"This prints if this assert fails 6 (good for debugging!)\"\n    assert candidate(-4, 6, 2)==True, \"This prints if this assert fails 7 (good for debugging!)\"\n\n    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.\n    assert candidate(2,1,1)==True, \"This prints if this assert fails 8 (also good for debugging!)\"\n    assert candidate(3,4,7)==True, \"This prints if this assert fails 9 (also good for debugging!)\"\n    assert candidate(3.0,4,7)==False, \"This prints if this assert fails 10 (also good for debugging!)\"\n\n\ncheck(any_int)", "correct_code": "\ndef any_int(x, y, z):\n    '''\n    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.\n    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.\n    Returns false in any other cases.\n    \n    Examples\n    any_int(5, 2, 7) ➞ True\n    \n    any_int(3, 2, 2) ➞ False\n\n    any_int(3, -2, 1) ➞ True\n    \n    any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) ➞ False\n  \n\n    \n    '''\n\n    \n    if isinstance(x,int) and isinstance(y,int) and isinstance(z,int):\n        if (x+y==z) or (x+z==y) or (y+z==x):\n            return True\n        return False\n    return False\n"}

Additionally, the use of a stack is appropriate for balancing brackets, but the logic for counting nested structures could be simplified to improve readability and efficiency. Lastly, the @@Correct Code suggests a different approach that tracks indices of opening and closing brackets, which may provide a clearer understanding of nesting but lacks clarity in its logic and could benefit from better variable naming and comments for maintainability.\nHere is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:\n[WinError 2] 系统找不到指定的文件。\n[]", "isTrue": false}]}], "test": "def check(candidate):\n\n    # Check some simple cases\n    assert candidate('[[]]') == True, \"This prints if this assert fails 1 (good for debugging!)\"\n    assert candidate('[]]]]]]][[[[[]') == False\n    assert candidate('[][]') == False\n    assert candidate(('[]')) == False\n    assert candidate('[[[[]]]]') == True\n    assert candidate('[]]]]]]]]]]') == False\n    assert candidate('[][][[]]') == True\n    assert candidate('[[]') == False\n    assert candidate('[]]') == False\n    assert candidate('[[]][[') == True\n    assert candidate('[[][]]') == True\n\n    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.\n    assert candidate('') == False, \"This prints if this assert fails 2 (also good for debugging!)\"\n    assert candidate('[[[[[[[[') == False\n    assert candidate(']]]]]]]]') == False\n\n\ncheck(is_nested)", "correct_code": "\ndef is_nested(string):\n    '''\n    Create a function that takes a string as input which contains only square brackets.\n    The function should return True if and only if there is a valid subsequence of brackets \n    where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.\n\n    is_nested('[[]]') ➞ True\n    is_nested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]') ➞ False\n    is_nested('[][]') ➞ False\n    is_nested('[]') ➞ False\n    is_nested('[[][]]') ➞ True\n    is_nested('[[]][[') ➞ True\n    '''\n\n    opening_bracket_index = []\n    closing_bracket_index = []\n    for i in range(len(string)):\n        if string[i] == '[':\n            opening_bracket_index.append(i)\n        else:\n            closing_bracket_index.append(i)\n    closing_bracket_index.reverse()\n    cnt = 0\n    i = 0\n    l = len(closing_bracket_index)\n    for idx in opening_bracket_index:\n        if i < l and idx < closing_bracket_index[i]:\n            cnt += 1\n            i += 1\n    return cnt >= 2\n\n    \n"}

Please fix it.\nThe @@Existing Code could be improved by eliminating the unnecessary flag (`flg`) and instead using a boolean condition to check if any letters were found during the iteration, which would simplify the logic. Additionally, the string concatenation in the second loop can be optimized by using `''.join(new_str)` directly instead of appending each character individually, which is less efficient. Lastly, the reversal of the string in the case of no letters found can be done more clearly by directly returning the reversed string without needing to manipulate the index.\nHere is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:\n[WinError 2] 系统找不到指定的文件。\n[]", "isTrue": false}]}], "test": "def check(candidate):\n\n    # Check some simple cases\n    assert candidate(\"AsDf\") == \"aSdF\"\n    assert candidate(\"1234\") == \"4321\"\n    assert candidate(\"ab\") == \"AB\"\n    assert candidate(\"#a@C\") == \"#A@c\"\n    assert candidate(\"#AsdfW^45\") == \"#aSDFw^45\"\n    assert candidate(\"#6@2\") == \"2@6#\"\n\n    # Check some edge cases that are easy to work out by hand.\n    assert candidate(\"#$a^D\") == \"#$A^d\"\n    assert candidate(\"#ccc\") == \"#CCC\"\n\n    # Don't remove this line:\n\ncheck(solve)", "correct_code": "\ndef solve(s):\n    \"\"\"You are given a string s.\n    if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, \n    otherwise keep it as it is.\n    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.\n    The function should return the resulted string.\n    Examples\n    solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"\n    solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"\n    solve(\"#a@C\") = \"#A@c\"\n    \"\"\"\n\n    flg = 0\n    idx = 0\n    new_str = list(s)\n    for i in s:\n        if i.isalpha():\n            new_str[idx] = i.swapcase()\n            flg = 1\n        idx += 1\n    s = \"\"\n    for i in new_str:\n        s += i\n    if flg == 0:\n        return s[len(s)::-1]\n    return s\n"}
