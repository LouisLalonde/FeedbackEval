@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not utilize the `divmod` function, which could simplify the calculations for hours, minutes, and seconds, leading to cleaner and more efficient code. Additionally, it lacks the integration with the `Time` class and the `FixedOffset` timezone handling, which are crucial for returning the correct time representation based on the provided context. Lastly, the return type should be explicitly a `Time` object, as indicated in the @@Docstring, rather than a formatted string, to align with the intended functionality.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not properly handle the timezone offset when creating the `Time` object, as it directly uses the `FixedOffset` without considering the correct conversion of the `tz` parameter into hours and minutes, which could lead to incorrect time representations. Additionally, the @@Correct Code utilizes the `map` function for cleaner and more efficient conversions of time components, which is a good practice to adopt for readability and performance. Lastly, the @@Existing Code lacks the localization step for the `Time` object when a timezone is provided, which is essential for ensuring that the time reflects the correct timezone context.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several discrepancies compared to the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. Firstly, the docstring indicates that the function should only handle `Time` objects, but the code also accepts `datetime.time`, which is not aligned with the docstring's type specification. Additionally, the handling of time values should be in nanoseconds rather than ticks, and the offset handling is inconsistent with the correct implementation, which uses `tzinfo` to check for timezone information. To improve the code, ensure that it strictly adheres to the documented type, utilize nanoseconds for time representation, and correctly manage timezone offsets using `tzinfo`.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains redundant class definitions for `Point` within each conditional block, which should be avoided to enhance readability and maintainability; instead, consider defining the `Point` class outside the function. Additionally, the existing code does not handle cases where the input length exceeds four dimensions, while the @@Correct Code raises a `ValueError` for unsupported dimensions, which is a more robust approach. Lastly, the @@Correct Code utilizes a `Structure` class to encapsulate the point data, suggesting a need to align the output format with the expected structure rather than returning a `Point` object directly.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not align with the docstring's specification that the input should be of type `Point`, as it currently accepts a list or tuple instead. Additionally, the correct code indicates that the `Point` class may have an attribute `srid`, which is not utilized in the existing code, leading to potential loss of important data during the dehydration process.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not align with the @@Docstring, as it returns instances of protocol handlers rather than a dictionary keyed by version tuples, which is specified in the docstring. Additionally, it lacks type checking for the `protocol_version` parameter, which should raise a `TypeError` if the input is not a tuple, as indicated in the docstring. To improve the code, consider restructuring it to return a dictionary of handlers and include the necessary type validation to ensure compliance with the expected behavior.

This function is a decorator for transaction functions that allows extra control over how the transaction is carried out.

    a dictionary with metadata.
    Specified metadata will be attached to the executing transaction and visible in the output of ``dbms.listQueries`` and ``dbms.listTransactions`` procedures.
    It will also get logged to the ``query.log``.
    This functionality makes it easier to tag transactions and is equivalent to ``dbms.setTXMetaData`` procedure, see https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/procedures/ for procedure reference.
:type metadata: dict

:param timeout:
    the transaction timeout in seconds.
    Transactions that execute longer than the configured timeout will be terminated by the database.
    This functionality allows to limit query/transaction execution time.
    Specified timeout overrides the default timeout configured in the database using ``dbms.transaction.timeout`` setting.
    Value should not represent a negative duration.
    A zero duration will make the transaction execute indefinitely.
    None will use the default timeout configured in the database.

To improve it, consider implementing the logic that attaches the `metadata` to the transaction and enforces the `timeout` during execution, ensuring that these functionalities align with the expectations set forth in the documentation.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains a nested class `TransactionContext` that simulates a transaction context, but it lacks the actual integration with the database as described in the @@Docstring, which may lead to confusion about its functionality. Additionally, the decorator does not attach the `metadata` and `timeout` attributes to the wrapped function, which is crucial for logging and transaction management as specified in the documentation. To improve, consider simplifying the transaction handling by directly passing the `metadata` and `timeout` to the decorated function and ensuring that the decorator's behavior aligns with the expected transaction control described in the docstring.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a critical issue in the integer key handling; it should allow for an index of `0` instead of starting from `1`, as indicated in the correct code. Additionally, ensure that the error messages for `IndexError`, `KeyError`, and `TypeError` provide sufficient context by including a message that describes the nature of the error. Lastly, consider adding type hints to the function signature for improved clarity and type safety, as this can enhance code readability and maintainability.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code correctly implements the functionality described in the docstring, but there are a few areas for improvement. First, consider using a private attribute (e.g., `self.__keys`) for encapsulation, which aligns with the correct code and enhances data integrity. Additionally, simplifying the exception handling by directly raising the exceptions with the key value instead of formatted messages can make the code cleaner and more consistent with the correct code.

The existing code does not fully align with the docstring, particularly in how it handles missing keys; instead of silently passing, it may be more informative to append `None` for missing keys, as shown in the correct code. Additionally, the correct code uses `self.index(key)` instead of `self.index[key]`, suggesting a potential misunderstanding of how the index should be accessed, which could lead to errors if `self.index` is not callable.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a few issues compared to the correct code and the docstring. First, the handling of the `keys` parameter is inconsistent; the correct code checks if `keys` are provided before proceeding, while the existing code does not optimize this check, leading to unnecessary iterations. Additionally, the existing code's error handling for accessing `self.index` could be simplified by directly checking if `self.index` is a dictionary, rather than relying on exception handling, which can be less efficient and harder to read. Lastly, the existing code uses `self.index.get(key)` but does not utilize the index as a callable, which is a deviation from the expected behavior described in the docstring.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code correctly implements the functionality described in the @@Docstring, but it could be optimized for clarity and efficiency. Specifically, consider simplifying the logic by directly leveraging the `items` method to retrieve key-value pairs, which would eliminate the need for manual index handling and the associated error checking, thus making the code cleaner and more maintainable. Additionally, ensure that the handling of `None` values for non-existent keys aligns with the expected behavior, as the current implementation may lead to confusion regarding the distinction between absent keys and keys with `None` values.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not properly implement the functionality described in the docstring, as it simply pops the last two elements from the data structure without considering their order or converting them into a big-endian 16-bit unsigned integer. Additionally, it lacks error handling for cases where fewer than two bytes are available, which is addressed in the correct code by checking the `self.used` variable. To improve the code, consider implementing a check for sufficient data before popping and ensure that the returned value is constructed correctly as a big-endian integer.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not log the DISCARD operation, which is important for debugging and tracking, as indicated by the Oracle Context. Additionally, while the parameters `n` and `qid` are ignored, the code could explicitly document this behavior to avoid confusion for future maintainers. Lastly, consider ensuring that the handlers are properly integrated into the `Response` object, as the correct code demonstrates a more structured approach to handling these parameters.

The @@Existing Code correctly acknowledges that the parameters `n` and `qid` are ignored, but it could enhance clarity by explicitly stating this in the docstring to align with the behavior described. Additionally, the logging statement could be more informative by including the context of the operation, such as the local port, which would aid in debugging. Lastly, consider simplifying the structure of the `discard_message` to directly pass the necessary parameters to the `_append` method, as this would streamline the operation and reduce unnecessary complexity.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code lacks any implementation and does not perform the necessary validations or raise exceptions as outlined in the @@Correct Code, which is crucial for handling various input parameters effectively. Additionally, the absence of logging and the `_append` method call means it does not interact with the output queue or provide feedback, which is essential for debugging and tracking transactions.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several areas for improvement based on the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. First, the validation for `db` and `imp_user` should raise a `ConfigurationError` if they are provided, as indicated in the @@Correct Code, which reflects protocol limitations. Additionally, the logging statement should include the local port and format the output string to match the @@Correct Code's style, enhancing clarity and consistency in logging. Finally, consider using `int` and `float` conversions in a try-except block for `timeout` to ensure robust error handling, as seen in the @@Correct Code.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code and @@Docstring. Firstly, the handling of `db` and `imp_user` should raise a `ConfigurationError` if they are provided, as indicated in the @@Correct Code, which emphasizes that these parameters are unsupported in certain protocol versions. Additionally, the logging and output structure should be aligned with the @@Correct Code to ensure consistency in how messages are formatted and how data is passed to the `_append` method, particularly regarding the handling of `timeout` and `metadata` as well as the format of the `bookmarks` parameter. Lastly, consider refining the validation logic to ensure that exceptions are raised with clear and specific messages, enhancing the clarity and usability of the function.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code lacks the necessary logic to dynamically create a Point subclass as described in the @@Docstring, as it only creates a basic type without any attributes or methods. To align with the @@Correct Code, you should implement property accessors for the fields and handle the SRID mapping, ensuring that the class properly inherits from the Point class and integrates with the srid_table and srid_table_lock. Additionally, consider implementing error handling for accessing fields and SRID values to enhance robustness and maintainability.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code defines a dynamic subclass of `Point`, but it introduces complexity with the `srid` property and setter that could be simplified by directly using the `srid_map` without locking if thread safety is not a concern. Additionally, the `__repr__` method could be enhanced for clarity by ensuring it reflects the dynamic nature of the class, and the `as_dict` method could be optimized by using a dictionary comprehension that directly references `fields`. Lastly, the @@Correct Code suggests a more streamlined approach to dynamically creating properties and handling SRID mapping, which could improve maintainability and readability.

The @@Existing Code successfully defines a dynamic subclass of `Point`, but it lacks the flexibility and efficiency seen in the @@Correct Code, particularly in how it handles properties and SRID mapping.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code is mostly aligned with the docstring and the correct code, but there are a couple of improvements to consider. First, the `stack_level` parameter in the `deprecation_warn` function should be an integer (2 instead of 2.0) for consistency and to avoid potential type issues. Additionally, while the code structure is sound, ensuring that the decorator handles edge cases (like non-callable inputs) could enhance its robustness.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code, primarily in error handling and output types. First, consider changing the output type from `str` to `bytes` to align with the correct implementation, which can help avoid encoding issues when dealing with binary data. Additionally, the existing code lacks robust error handling for cases where the command might not be found or executed, as seen in the correct version; implementing similar checks would enhance reliability and user feedback. Lastly, the concurrency management could be refined by utilizing a thread pool or similar mechanism to better control the number of concurrent executions, ensuring it adheres to the `target_concurrency` parameter effectively.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code. First, it lacks error handling for cases where the command might not be found, which is addressed in the @@Correct Code through the use of a custom exception. Additionally, the threading implementation in the @@Existing Code does not efficiently manage the number of concurrent threads, as it only starts a fixed number without considering the total number of partitions, which could lead to underutilization of resources. Lastly, the @@Existing Code does not account for platform-specific command length limitations, particularly for Windows batch files, which is an important detail in the @@Correct Code.

The existing code does not utilize a fixed random seed as indicated in the docstring and the correct code, which is essential for achieving a deterministic shuffle.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code correctly implements a deterministic shuffle, but it lacks clarity in the docstring, which should explicitly mention that it uses a fixed seed for reproducibility. Additionally, while the use of `random.Random(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)` is valid, it would be more transparent to explicitly call the `seed` method on the `rng` object to clarify the seeding process. Lastly, consider ensuring that the function's behavior is consistent with the docstring by including a brief explanation of the shuffle's deterministic nature in the comments or docstring.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code generally adheres to the docstring and performs the intended functionality, but there are a couple of improvements to consider. First, the `seed` method in the correct code specifies a version argument, which ensures compatibility with different versions of the random module; incorporating this would enhance reproducibility. Additionally, while the existing code converts the input sequence to a list, it could be beneficial to clarify that this operation is necessary for the shuffle method, ensuring that users understand the input requirements more explicitly.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly splits the version string using a comma instead of a period, which does not align with the expected format for version comparisons (as indicated by the correct code). To improve the function, ensure that the string is split by the correct delimiter (a period) to accurately parse version numbers. Additionally, consider adding error handling to manage cases where the input string may not be formatted correctly, enhancing the robustness of the function.

The @@Existing Code lacks handling for scenarios where the cache is `None`, which is addressed in the @@Correct Code, ensuring that the function executes normally without caching. Additionally, the @@Existing Code does not utilize the `key` function properly to generate cache keys based on the function's arguments, which could lead to incorrect caching behavior; the @@Correct Code demonstrates a more robust approach by using `key(*args, **kwargs)`. Lastly, the @@Existing Code does not account for potential exceptions when storing values in the cache, such as `ValueError`, which the @@Correct Code handles to prevent crashes due to large values.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not handle the case where `maxsize` is `None` or when `maxsize` is a callable, which are essential for the intended functionality as described in the docstring and exemplified in the correct code. Additionally, the existing implementation lacks the integration of a TTL cache class, which would provide a more structured approach to managing cache entries and their expiration. To improve the code, consider implementing these conditions and utilizing a dedicated cache class to ensure adherence to the expected behavior and enhance maintainability.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code for the `ttl_cache` decorator does not handle the case where `maxsize` is `None`, which is present in the correct code, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when no size limit is desired. Additionally, the logic for determining the cache key could be optimized to ensure consistent behavior with typed arguments, as the current implementation may not correctly differentiate between different types of arguments. Lastly, the `misses` counter should be incremented only when a new value is computed and added to the cache, rather than every time the function is called, to accurately reflect cache misses.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a logical error in the first conditional statement where it checks if `maxsize >= None`, which should instead use `is None` to correctly identify when `maxsize` is not set. Additionally, the code should ensure that the handling of the `maxsize` parameter aligns with the expected behavior described in the docstring and the correct code, particularly regarding the default case when it is not provided. Lastly, consider adding type hints for better clarity and maintainability, which can improve the interaction with external elements as indicated in the Oracle Context.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code incorrectly redefines the `lru_cache` function, which leads to a conflict with the intended memoization functionality described in the @@Docstring. To improve this code, you should ensure that the decorator properly initializes the cache based on the provided `maxsize` and `typed` parameters, and correctly handles cases where `maxsize` is `None` or a callable. Additionally, consider implementing error handling for invalid inputs to enhance robustness and maintain clarity in the code's purpose.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few discrepancies compared to the @@Correct Code and @@Docstring. Firstly, the use of `_lru_cache` instead of `_cache` and `LRUCache` indicates a potential misunderstanding of the intended caching mechanism, which may lead to incorrect behavior or performance issues. Additionally, the handling of the `maxsize` parameter could be streamlined by directly returning the cache for callable cases without the need for an intermediate decorator function, enhancing clarity and efficiency.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement to align with the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. First, the handling of the `maxsize` parameter in the `lfu_cache` function should explicitly check for `None` before processing callable types, as seen in the @@Correct Code, to avoid unnecessary cache creation. Additionally, the `put` method in the `LFUCache` class could benefit from a more efficient eviction strategy by considering the case where multiple keys share the same minimum frequency, which is not addressed in the current implementation.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few issues compared to the @@Correct Code and @@Docstring. Firstly, the handling of the `maxsize` parameter in the `lfu_cache` function should account for the case when `maxsize` is `None`, which is currently missing; this could lead to unexpected behavior when no limit is set. Additionally, the integration with the `_cache` and `_UnboundCache` APIs is not implemented in the existing code, which is essential for proper functionality as indicated in the @@Oracle Context, and should be incorporated to ensure that the decorator works as intended. Lastly, the logic for handling the `maxsize` when it is callable should be refined to ensure that the cache is initialized correctly, as the current implementation does not align with the expected behavior outlined in the @@Correct Code.

The existing code deviates from the correct implementation by using `self.remove(key)` instead of `self.pop(key)`, which may lead to inconsistencies in behavior if `remove` does not function identically to `pop`. To align with the docstring's intent of removing and returning the first inserted key-value pair, ensure that the method used (i.e., `pop`) accurately reflects the expected behavior of returning the value associated with the key. Additionally, consider verifying that `self.__order` is properly maintained to reflect the insertion order, as any discrepancies could affect the reliability of the `popitem` method.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code directly accesses the `__dict__` attribute, which may not align with the intended behavior of the class if it has custom `__getitem__` or `__contains__` methods; using `self[key]` ensures that these methods are utilized. Additionally, the docstring specifies that the method should return `D[k]` if `k` is in `D`, which the existing code does not explicitly check, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the key is not found. Consider implementing an explicit check for key existence using `if key in self` to align with the documented functionality and improve clarity.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not fully adhere to the @@Docstring, as it lacks support for instance methods and does not handle the cache correctly per instance, which is crucial for memoization in object-oriented contexts. Additionally, the @@Existing Code does not implement error handling for cases where the cache is `None` or when a key is not found, which could lead to unhandled exceptions. To improve, consider restructuring the wrapper to ensure it correctly manages instance-level caching and includes robust error handling for cache access and value storage.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code lacks the handling of cache retrieval and storage in a way that accommodates potential race conditions, particularly when a lock is provided; this could lead to inconsistent cache states. Additionally, the error handling for cache operations could be improved by specifically addressing cases where the cache might be `None` or when values are too large, rather than using a generic exception handler. Finally, the logic for acquiring and releasing locks could be streamlined to ensure that they are only used when necessary, thus improving performance and clarity.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not utilize the class method decorator, which is present in the @@Correct Code, indicating a potential oversight in the intended design. Additionally, the error handling for converting the exception to a string could be improved by logging the error more effectively, as the current implementation does not specify a logger, which is referenced in the @@Correct Code. Lastly, the traceback extraction and formatting logic in the @@Existing Code could be simplified and made more efficient by directly leveraging the capabilities of the `traceback` module, rather than manually managing the frames.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not encapsulate the method within a class, which is a deviation from the @@Correct Code that defines `extostr` as a class method. Additionally, the error handling for the exception message formatting is less robust, as it does not account for potential `UnicodeEncodeError` or other exceptions that may arise during string conversion, which are addressed in the @@Correct Code. Lastly, the formatting of the traceback information lacks the detailed structure seen in the @@Correct Code, which improves readability and clarity, suggesting a need for a more comprehensive approach to building the output string.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several issues that deviate from the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. Firstly, the `write` method is incorrectly called with an extra argument (26), which is not necessary and could lead to unexpected behavior; it should simply be `rd.write(text_buffer)`. Secondly, the file opening mode for overwriting should be `"w"` instead of the current mode, which is not explicitly defined for overwriting, potentially leading to confusion about file creation and truncation. Lastly, the logging statements should include the exception details for better debugging, as seen in the @@Correct Code, which provides more context for the errors encountered.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few notable issues compared to the @@Correct Code and the @@Docstring. First, the method incorrectly states that it writes a "binary buffer" in the docstring, while it actually handles a text buffer, which should be clarified for accuracy. Additionally, the handling of file modes could be optimized by using "a+" for appending, which allows reading and writing without truncating the file, and the error logging could be improved by using structured logging to provide clearer context about the exceptions. Lastly, the use of `codecs.open` is somewhat outdated; consider using the built-in `open` function with the appropriate encoding for better compatibility and simplicity.

Additionally, the @@Existing Code does not utilize `codecs` for file operations, which is present in the @@Correct Code and may be necessary for handling specific encodings properly, and it also lacks a `finally` block to ensure the file is closed, which could lead to resource leaks.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several issues compared to the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. First, the method incorrectly attempts to read a limited number of bytes (94) instead of the entire file, which contradicts the docstring's statement about reading the whole file into memory. Additionally, the error logging in the exception handling does not utilize the exception message, which is present in the @@Correct Code, potentially obscuring the cause of the error; it should also ensure consistent logging messages that match the method name (`file_to_textbuffer` instead of `file_to_binary`). Lastly, the check for file existence includes an unnecessary parameter (13) in the `is_file_exist` method call, which should be removed to align with the expected functionality.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code generally follows the structure outlined in the @@Docstring, but there are several areas for improvement. Firstly, the error handling could be enhanced by providing more specific logging messages that align with the context of the exception, ensuring clarity in debugging; for example, the log messages should refer to "file_to_textbuffer" instead of "file_to_binary." Additionally, the use of `codecs.open` could be reconsidered in favor of the built-in `open` function, which is more commonly used and can handle encoding directly, thus simplifying the code. Lastly, consider using a context manager (the `with` statement) for file operations to ensure that the file is properly closed even if an error occurs, improving resource management.

The @@Existing Code generally aligns with the @@Docstring but could benefit from several improvements. Firstly, it should utilize the `codecs` module for opening files to handle various encodings more robustly, as seen in the @@Correct Code, which also emphasizes the importance of closing the file in a `finally` block to prevent resource leaks. Additionally, the error handling could be more specific by distinguishing between different types of IO errors and ensuring consistent logging messages, which would enhance clarity and maintainability.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code closely matches the @@Correct Code, but it lacks handling for potential edge cases, such as empty strings or paths that may not be valid. Consider adding a check for an empty string before proceeding to the file existence check, as this could improve robustness. Additionally, ensure that the logging messages are consistent in style and clarity, which can enhance maintainability and readability.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains redundant checks, such as verifying if `file_name` is an empty string after already checking for `None`, which could be streamlined for clarity and efficiency. Additionally, the logging message for non-string types should utilize a method to retrieve the class name, as shown in the @@Correct Code, to provide more informative logging. Lastly, the check for whether the path is a directory is unnecessary since `os.path.isfile` inherently checks for file existence and will return `False` if the path is a directory.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code lacks the necessary implementation to fulfill the purpose described in the docstring, which is to reset logging. To improve it, you should incorporate the logic from the correct code, ensuring that it initializes the root logger, sets its level to INFO, and properly closes and clears all handlers, thereby adhering to the expected behavior outlined in the docstring. Additionally, consider adding error handling to manage potential exceptions when closing handlers, as demonstrated in the correct code, to enhance robustness.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not fully reset all loggers, as it only addresses the root logger and its handlers, while the @@Correct Code iterates through all loggers in the logging manager to ensure they are also reset to INFO and their handlers closed. Additionally, the exception handling in the @@Existing Code uses a print statement, which is less effective than logging the error, as seen in the @@Correct Code. To improve, consider implementing a more comprehensive reset that includes all loggers and replace print statements with logging calls to maintain consistency in error handling.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code is generally aligned with the docstring's intent to reset logging, but it can be improved for clarity and efficiency. First, consider removing the redundant exception handling and logging of errors when closing handlers, as this can clutter the logs and may not be necessary if the goal is simply to reset the logging state; instead, focus on ensuring that handlers are closed without excessive error reporting. Additionally, the use of `logging.getLevelName("INFO")` in the correct code is more explicit than just using `logging.INFO`, which can enhance readability and maintainability, so adopting a consistent approach to setting log levels would be beneficial.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not align with the docstring's requirement to return the implementation without the 'Py' or 'Fallback' suffix. You should consider adding logic to filter or modify the output of `getObjectSpecification()` to ensure it meets this specification. Additionally, ensure that the import statement is placed at the module level for better performance and readability, as importing within the function can lead to unnecessary overhead.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code correctly retrieves the class name from the object specification but unnecessarily complicates the process by manually manipulating the class name string. To align more closely with the docstring's intent, consider directly returning the result of `getObjectSpecification(self)` without extracting and modifying the class name, as the correct code suggests. Additionally, ensure that the logic for handling suffixes is robust and accounts for potential variations in naming conventions, which may not be covered by simply checking for 'Py' or 'Fallback'.

The existing code does not maintain the order of elements as specified in the docstring, particularly when handling elements that appear in multiple orderings; it also uses a list for membership checks, which is less efficient than using a set.

Additionally, the logic should be adjusted to process the orderings in reverse to correctly preserve the suffix order as described in the docstring.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a few issues compared to the correct code and the docstring. First, the condition `if m >= candidates:` is incorrect; it should check if `m` is already in `candidates` using `if m in candidates:` to ensure proper handling of duplicates. Additionally, the comparison `if c <= ClassType` should be `if c is not ClassType`, as the goal is to filter out `ClassType` rather than include it. Lastly, the logic for checking subclasses should ensure that `m` is not equal to `n` to avoid false positives when `m` and `n` are the same class.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a couple of issues compared to the @@Correct Code. Firstly, it accesses the protected member `_Interface__attrs` directly, which can lead to maintenance challenges and violates encapsulation; instead, it should use `self.__attrs` as shown in the @@Correct Code. Secondly, the return type when `all` is `True` should be a dictionary view of items rather than a list, aligning with the behavior in the @@Correct Code, which enhances clarity and consistency in the output format.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a logical inconsistency in how it handles the `all` parameter; it should return `self.__attrs.items()` when `all` is `False`, rather than `True`, as indicated in the @@Correct Code. Additionally, the return type should be consistent; while the existing code returns a list, the correct implementation returns a view of the dictionary items, which may be more efficient and appropriate for the intended use. Lastly, ensure that the use of `self.__attrs` and `self.__bases__` aligns with the expected data structures and access patterns as per the @@Docstring and @@Oracle Context.

The @@Existing Code does not fully align with the @@Docstring, as it only returns keys from `self.__dict__`, which may not represent the complete interface attributes, especially in the context of inheritance.

The @@Existing Code does not align with the @@Correct Code in terms of how it retrieves attribute names, as it relies on the class's method resolution order (MRO) rather than a predefined attribute dictionary, which may lead to inconsistencies in the returned results.

To improve clarity and functionality, consider adopting a similar approach to the @@Correct Code by utilizing a dedicated attribute dictionary and refining the parameter name to better reflect its purpose.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a few issues that deviate from the intended functionality as described in the docstring and the correct code. Firstly, the `output.append(sequence, 9)` line incorrectly attempts to append with a second argument, which is not valid for the `append` method; it should simply be `output.append(sequence)`. Secondly, the recursive call to `_normalizeargs(v, output, 94)` includes an unnecessary third argument that is not defined in the function signature, which should be removed to align with the correct code. Lastly, ensure that the logic for handling the sequence is consistent with the expected input types, as the docstring mentions "Declarions" and "tuples," which may require additional checks or handling not present in the existing code.

The existing code lacks implementation, which is crucial for fulfilling the purpose described in the docstring. To improve it, consider incorporating checks for the PyPy environment and the relevant optimizations by leveraging the `_c_optimizations_required` and `_c_optimizations_ignored` functions, as well as using the `hasattr` function to determine if the current environment is PyPy. Additionally, ensure that the logic aligns with the conditions outlined in the docstring to accurately return a boolean value based on the specified criteria.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not fully align with the docstring, particularly in how it initializes `self.bins`, as it lacks the conditional checks for `_make_bins` and `_initial_bins` that ensure proper initialization based on their presence. Additionally, the use of `deepcopy` should be explicitly linked to the `copy` module, as indicated in the Oracle Context, which suggests a potential oversight in importing or referencing the `copy` class. Lastly, consider incorporating a fallback mechanism for initializing `self.bins` using `hf.init_bins`, as shown in the correct code, to ensure robustness in scenarios where both `_make_bins` and `_initial_bins` are absent.

The @@Existing Code does not fully adhere to the @@Docstring, particularly in how it initializes `self.bins`, as it does not account for the potential need for `self.edges` and `self._initial_value` in the call to `hf.init_bins()`.

The @@Existing Code contains a deprecated warning but does not fully align with the @@Docstring, which emphasizes that the method is not used in the current context and suggests using `lena.output.ToCSV` instead; consider removing the method entirely or implementing a clear redirect to the new functionality. Additionally, the handling of the header and point conversion could be optimized by using list comprehensions for better readability and performance, as seen in the @@Correct Code, which also improves the unpacking of coordinates and values. Lastly, ensure that the sorting logic is robust by checking the presence of the `_sort` attribute before calling `_update`, as this could lead to potential attribute errors if `_sort` is not defined.

The existing code has a few issues that need addressing. First, the `enumerate()` function is missing an iterable, which should be `self._parsed_error_names` as indicated in the correct code; this will ensure that the loop iterates over the intended data. Additionally, the `append` method is incorrectly used with two arguments (`ind + dim, 44`), whereas it should only append a single value (`ind + dim`), aligning with the intended functionality described in the docstring.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several issues compared to the @@Correct Code. Firstly, the slicing of `xyz_coord_names` should use `[:3]` instead of `[:3.0]`, as the latter is not valid in Python and may lead to confusion. Additionally, the comments in the @@Correct Code provide clarity on the purpose of certain operations, such as the private nature of the method and the handling of error suffixes, which could enhance readability and maintainability if included in the @@Existing Code. Lastly, ensure that the error handling logic is consistent with the intended behavior described in the @@Docstring, particularly regarding how errors are indexed and appended to the context.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a subtle issue in calculating the bin widths; it incorrectly accesses the edges by using `edges[coord][i] - edges[coord][i - 1]`, which may lead to off-by-one errors. Instead, it should use `edges[coord][i + 1] - edges[coord][i]` to correctly compute the width of each bin. Additionally, consider renaming `bin_widths` to `bin_lengths` for clarity, as it better reflects the purpose of the variable in the context of calculating volume.

The existing code correctly checks if the sequence can be converted to a `FillRequestSeq`, but it could benefit from improved readability and efficiency.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code checks if the object has either the 'fill' or 'compute' methods, but the docstring implies that both methods should be present and executable, which is not reflected in the current logic. To align with the docstring and the correct code, you should modify the condition to ensure that both methods exist and are callable. Additionally, consider using a more explicit logical structure to enhance readability and maintainability, ensuring that the function accurately reflects its intended purpose.

The existing code does not implement the recursive functionality described in the docstring, which is crucial for handling nested dictionaries and for comparing values at different levels. Additionally, it lacks the necessary checks to ensure that both `d1` and `d2` are dictionaries, which could lead to errors if they are not.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains a few issues that could be improved for better adherence to the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. Firstly, the error handling for non-dictionary inputs is inconsistent; it should return `d1` directly only if `d2` is a dictionary, otherwise raise a `TypeError` for both being non-dictionaries. Secondly, the recursive logic should be simplified by avoiding deep copies unless necessary, as this can lead to unnecessary performance overhead, and the check for equality between `d1` and `d2` at the start would help short-circuit the function when they are identical, returning an empty dictionary immediately.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not fully align with the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code, as it lacks the handling of multiple bin indices and does not account for underflow or overflow conditions effectively. Additionally, the error handling is overly broad, potentially masking specific issues that could be addressed more directly, such as distinguishing between out-of-bounds access and other exceptions. To improve, consider implementing a more explicit check for underflow and overflow conditions, and ensure that the logic for handling multiple bin indices is incorporated to match the expected behavior described in the docstring.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement: first, it does not utilize the `self.edges` attribute as seen in the @@Correct Code, which may lead to incorrect bin calculations; consider integrating this to ensure proper handling of histogram boundaries. Additionally, the error handling could be streamlined; instead of catching a broad `Exception`, focus on specific exceptions related to index errors to avoid masking potential issues. Lastly, the logic for handling underflow and overflow could be simplified by returning early when conditions are met, enhancing readability and maintainability.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a logical flaw by using an infinite loop (`while True`) without iterating over the `labels`, which prevents it from validating the keys and values as intended. Additionally, the error handling for `validate_value` may not correctly associate the error with the corresponding key, as it uses `str(value)` instead of linking it to the key that caused the error. Finally, ensure that the error messages are consistent with the expected output in the docstring, particularly regarding the format of the error messages.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a minor inconsistency in how it captures errors for values; it currently appends the key-value pair as a single string instead of just the value, which may lead to confusion in error reporting. Additionally, the error handling could be enhanced by ensuring that all errors are collected before raising the `ValidationError`, allowing for a more comprehensive error report. Finally, consider validating the types of keys and values before calling the validation functions to avoid unnecessary exceptions and improve performance.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code correctly follows the docstring's intent but could be improved by consolidating error handling for both key and value validation, as the correct code does, which allows for catching both `ValidationError` and `TypeError` in a single block. Additionally, the existing code should ensure that it captures all errors for both keys and values before raising the `ValidationError`, rather than stopping at the first encountered error for each. Lastly, consider adding a check for the type of `labels` to ensure it is a dictionary, which would enhance robustness against incorrect input types.

The @@Existing Code correctly implements the validation logic but misses a few key aspects highlighted in the @@Correct Code. Firstly, it should unpack the result of `_get_labels_regex()` to obtain the regex pattern, which is crucial for proper validation; currently, it assumes the function returns a single pattern. Additionally, the error message could be enhanced for clarity by including the expected pattern, which helps users understand the validation failure better.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few discrepancies compared to the @@Correct Code and @@Docstring. Firstly, the unpacking of `_get_labels_regex()` is incorrect; the correct code uses the second element as `value_regex`, which should be directly used for validation instead of `pattern`. Additionally, the error message in the @@Existing Code should use `value_regex` instead of `_label_value_pattern`, as the latter is not defined in the current scope, leading to potential confusion or errors. Lastly, consider ensuring that the validation message is more informative by including the expected format or pattern in a clearer manner.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not raise a `ValidationError` as specified in the docstring, which is a critical requirement for proper error handling. Additionally, it uses `re.match` instead of the more appropriate `fullmatch` method, which ensures the entire string conforms to the regex pattern. Lastly, the code lacks the integration of `_get_labels_regex()` to dynamically retrieve the regex pattern, which could enhance flexibility and maintainability.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code correctly implements the validation logic but misses a few key improvements highlighted in the correct code. First, ensure that the regex pattern is unpacked from `_get_labels_regex()` to maintain consistency with the expected structure, as indicated by the correct code. Additionally, consider using formatted string literals for clearer error messages, which improves readability and provides more context about the failure, including the expected pattern. Finally, ensure that the error message references the `_label_key_pattern` variable for better debugging and adherence to the Oracle context.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code diverges from the correct code in key areas: it uses `get` for accessing `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata`, which can lead to `None` values if these keys are absent, whereas the correct code assumes their presence; this could lead to runtime errors. Additionally, the existing code initializes `observer_schema_dict["metadata"]` without checking if it exists, which could raise a `KeyError` if `metadata` is not present in `manifest_dict`. To improve robustness, consider adding checks to ensure that required keys exist before accessing them, or use `dict.get()` with default values to handle potential missing keys gracefully.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code correctly implements the recursive structure described in the docstring, but it has a few potential issues. Firstly, when accessing keys like `"apiVersion"`, `"kind"`, and `"metadata"`, it should use the `.get()` method to avoid `KeyError` exceptions if those keys are missing in `manifest_dict`. Secondly, the assignment to `observer_schema_dict["metadata"]["name"]` assumes that `"metadata"` exists and is a dictionary, which could lead to errors; it would be safer to initialize it first if it doesn't exist. Lastly, consider adding type hints to the function signature for better clarity and type safety.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a critical issue with the slicing of `observer_schema` using `[:-1.0]`, which is incorrect since the slice should use an integer index, not a float; this could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Additionally, the comments in the correct code provide valuable context that is missing in the existing code, which can enhance readability and maintainability; consider adding similar comments to clarify the logic behind each step. Lastly, ensure that the function consistently checks for the presence of elements in `last_applied_manifest` before appending, as this will prevent unnecessary growth of the list and maintain its integrity.

The @@Existing Code does not fully adhere to the @@Docstring, particularly in its handling of keys and the expected structure of the response; it assumes the presence of the "observed" field without checking each key from the observer schema against the response.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code. Firstly, the existing implementation does not validate that all keys in the `observer_schema` are present in the `response`, which could lead to unhandled cases; adding this check would enhance robustness. Secondly, the recursive calls should directly reference the corresponding keys in `observer_schema` and `response` to ensure that the correct values are being passed, which is not consistently done in the existing code. Lastly, consider adding more descriptive error messages to improve debugging when a `KeyError` is raised, as the existing messages are less informative.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code generally adheres to the @@Docstring but could benefit from improved clarity and consistency in error messaging, such as using a consistent format for the TypeError message. Additionally, consider adding comments to clarify the purpose of each code block, which would enhance readability and maintainability, especially for future developers. Lastly, ensure that the handling of `_BYTES_ENCODING` is well-documented or defined within the class to avoid potential confusion regarding its origin or purpose.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code. Firstly, consider using a constant for the encoding (like `_BYTES_ENCODING`) instead of hardcoding 'utf-8' to enhance maintainability and clarity. Secondly, ensure that error messages are consistent and formatted uniformly, as seen in the @@Correct Code, which improves readability and debugging. Lastly, it may be beneficial to clarify the distinction between `self.converter` and `self._converter` to maintain consistency in naming conventions and ensure that the correct instance variable is being used.

The @@Existing Code lacks the implementation details necessary to fulfill the purpose outlined in the @@Docstring, specifically the conversion of in-style parameters to out-style parameters, which is crucial for its functionality. Additionally, the code does not include error handling for cases where `many_params` might not conform to the expected types (mapping or sequence), which could lead to runtime errors.

*sql* (:class:`str` or :class:`bytes`) is the SQL query.

*many_params* (:class:`~collections.abc.Iterable`) contains each set
of in-style parameters (*params*).

-       *params* (:class:`~collections.abc.Mapping` or :class:`~collections.abc.Sequence`)
        contains the set of in-style parameters. It maps each parameter

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several areas for improvement to align it with the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. First, the handling of the SQL string and its encoding could be streamlined by normalizing the SQL input at the beginning, which would simplify subsequent logic and ensure consistent handling of string types. Additionally, the conversion of parameters should explicitly reflect the distinction between in-style and out-style parameters, which is not clearly addressed in the existing logic; consider incorporating a dedicated conversion method that aligns with the expected behavior described in the docstring. Lastly, ensure that error messages provide more context about the input values, which can aid in debugging and improve user experience.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement to align better with the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. First, the normalization of the SQL input could be simplified by directly handling the encoding and type checks in one step, rather than having a separate `_normalize_sql` method, which may lead to redundancy and confusion. Additionally, the error messages should be more informative and consistent, providing context about the expected types and the actual types received, similar to the @@Correct Code's approach, which enhances debugging and usability. Lastly, consider refactoring the parameter conversion logic to utilize a dedicated converter method, as seen in the @@Correct Code, to improve clarity and maintainability.

The @@Existing Code contains several critical deviations from the @@Correct Code and the @@Docstring, particularly in the handling of return values and error conditions. Specifically, the return value in the `CreateFailed` exception should be `False` instead of `True`, and the logic for determining `inventory_is_valid` should check for zero errors (`== 0`) rather than non-zero errors (`!= 0`). Additionally, the condition for logging an error when there is only one `namaste` should be `>` instead of `==`, as the original intention seems to be to warn about multiple declarations rather than a single one. These changes are essential to ensure the function behaves as documented and correctly reflects the validation logic.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a minor issue in the return statement where it uses `s[:-1.0]`, which is incorrect since slicing should use an integer index, not a float; this could lead to a TypeError. Additionally, while the current implementation concatenates strings in a loop, it may be more efficient to use a list to collect messages and then join them at the end, which would improve performance for larger datasets. Lastly, ensure that the method handles cases where `self.messages` might be empty, as returning an empty string is preferable to returning a string with a trailing newline.

The existing code incorrectly passes a hardcoded integer (95) as the first argument to `self.log.status_str`, which may not align with the intended functionality described in the docstring. To improve the code, ensure that the method adheres to the expected behavior by removing the hardcoded value and only passing the `prefix` argument.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains a critical error in the handling of the 'digestAlgorithm' check, where it incorrectly allows 'sha256' instead of 'sha512' as per the @@Correct Code. Additionally, the logic for checking the 'contentDirectory' could be enhanced by explicitly validating that it does not contain any unsafe characters or patterns beyond just checking for slashes, which would improve security. Lastly, consider consolidating repetitive error handling logic to streamline the code and enhance readability, ensuring that similar checks are grouped together for clarity.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few discrepancies compared to the @@Correct Code, particularly in the handling of the `digestAlgorithm` check, where it incorrectly checks for 'sha512' twice instead of checking for 'sha256' as in the correct version. Additionally, the logic for validating the `contentDirectory` could be improved by explicitly checking for safe characters instead of just checking for slashes and the current directory indicators. Lastly, consider consolidating repeated error handling logic to enhance readability and maintainability, ensuring that similar checks are grouped together for clarity.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a critical issue in the handling of the `digestAlgorithm` field, where it incorrectly checks for 'sha256' instead of 'sha512' in one of the conditions, which could lead to improper validation results. Additionally, the code could benefit from more consistent error handling and logging practices to ensure that all potential issues are captured and reported uniformly, enhancing maintainability and clarity. Lastly, consider refactoring repeated logic, such as the URL construction for expected types, into a separate function to improve readability and reduce duplication.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code lacks implementation and does not perform the necessary checks as described in the docstring, which states the function should verify that required digests are present and used. To align with the correct code, consider implementing logic to create sets from the input lists, utilize set operations to identify missing digests, and invoke the error method appropriately with relevant messages. Additionally, ensure that the function adheres to the expected input types and handles any potential edge cases, such as empty lists or invalid data types.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not fully align with the docstring, as it assumes `manifest_files` is a list, while the correct implementation treats it as a dictionary (using `.values()`). Additionally, the error codes used in the existing code are not consistent with those in the correct code, which could lead to confusion in error handling. Lastly, consider simplifying the error checks by directly using the length of the differences instead of creating intermediate variables, which can enhance readability and performance.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code lacks comprehensive checks for version compatibility and does not account for potential differences in digest algorithms between versions, which is crucial for ensuring integrity when comparing inventories. Additionally, the error handling could be more informative by including relevant context, such as the version being compared and specific differences found, which would aid in debugging. Lastly, the @@Existing Code could benefit from a more structured approach to checking mappings and metadata, similar to the @@Correct Code, to enhance clarity and maintainability.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code correctly checks if the `prior` object is an instance of `InventoryValidator` and verifies subset relationships, but it lacks a more comprehensive version comparison that considers all versions, as seen in the correct code. Additionally, the error handling could be improved by providing more context in the error messages, such as including the specific version being checked, which would aid in debugging. Finally, the existing code does not account for potential differences in metadata between versions, which is crucial for ensuring compatibility and consistency.

The @@Existing Code correctly initializes a logical path map and checks for the existence of the specified version, but it diverges from the @@Docstring by not accurately reflecting the structure of the inventory and its manifest; it should directly access the state associated with the version instead of iterating over the manifest. Additionally, the @@Correct Code suggests that the logical paths should be constructed based on the state and its associated files, which is not fully captured in the @@Existing Code's approach. To improve, consider aligning the data access patterns with the expected structure of the inventory and ensuring that the logical path construction reflects the relationships between states and their content files more accurately.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a critical logical error in the final check where it verifies if a file is in the manifest; it incorrectly uses `if file in manifest_files` instead of `if file not in manifest_files`, which contradicts the docstring's requirement to ensure that only files listed in the manifest are referenced. Additionally, consider improving the clarity of error messages by including more context about the specific issue encountered, such as the expected format or the nature of the mismatch. Lastly, ensure that the variable names are consistently spelled (e.g., "fixity_algoritm_block" should be "fixity_algorithm_block") to enhance readability and maintainability.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not fully implement the intended functionality described in the docstring, as it lacks the logic to create `Package` instances and manage file types, which are crucial for grouping files by their XML basenames. Additionally, the method of checking for XML in file names is overly simplistic and does not utilize the `os` module for proper basename extraction and file type differentiation, which is evident in the correct code. To improve, consider incorporating the creation of `Package` objects and the logic for handling different file types, as well as ensuring that the function adheres to the expected input and output types as outlined in the docstring.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not fully align with the docstring, particularly in how it handles the XML base name and the structure of the returned dictionary; it uses the full XML filename as the key instead of the base name. Additionally, the existing code lacks the logic to differentiate between asset types and does not utilize the `_eval_file` function, which is crucial for determining the file type and handling accordingly. To improve, consider implementing the logic for evaluating files based on their type and ensure that the dictionary keys are consistent with the XML base names as described in the docstring.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not fully align with the @@Docstring, as it checks for suffixes rather than prefixes, which contradicts the stated purpose of identifying files by their prefix. Additionally, the @@Oracle Context suggests using the `os` module's `basename` function, which is not utilized in the existing implementation, potentially leading to incorrect evaluations of the file path. To improve the code, consider restructuring it to use `os.path.basename` to extract the filename and then check if it starts with the specified prefix, ensuring it adheres to both the docstring and the context provided.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly calls the `match_file_by_prefix` function without passing the necessary `item` argument, which is essential for checking if the filename matches the prefix.

The @@Existing Code lacks integration with the `file_utils` class, which is essential according to the @@Oracle Context, as it should utilize methods like `is_folder`, `xml_files_list`, and `files_list` from this class. Additionally, the @@Correct Code suggests that the `_group_files_by_xml_filename` function may require more parameters than just the XML files list, indicating a potential oversight in how files are grouped.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not fully adhere to the @@Docstring, as it lacks the functionality to differentiate between 'asset' and 'rendition' types, which is a key requirement. Additionally, it does not utilize the `match_file_by_prefix` function from the @@Oracle Context, which is essential for validating the file name against the provided prefix. To improve the code, consider implementing checks for the file type and structure as described in the @@Correct Code, ensuring that the logic for identifying 'original' and 'rendition' files is accurately reflected.

The @@Existing Code does not fully align with the @@Docstring, particularly in terms of parameters and return values; it lacks handling for `file_folder` and does not return a complete dictionary as described.

The existing code incorrectly calls `self.file_path()` without passing the `file_path` argument, which likely leads to an error or unintended behavior, as indicated by the correct code. To improve this, ensure that the method correctly utilizes the `file_path` parameter by passing it to `self.file_path()`. Additionally, verify that the `_renditions` dictionary is initialized before this method is called to avoid potential attribute errors.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code correctly checks for the existence of the basename and the file path, but it lacks clarity regarding the expected format of the assets dictionary as described in the docstring; consider explicitly stating the expected structure in the docstring for better understanding. Additionally, the use of `self.file_path(file_path).exists()` implies that `file_path` is being treated as a method, which may lead to confusion; ensure that the method is correctly defined and clarify its purpose. Lastly, the correct code omits error handling, which is crucial for robustness, so consider retaining the checks for existing basenames and file paths to prevent potential runtime errors.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code correctly implements the functionality described in the @@Docstring, but it misses an important aspect of the @@Correct Code, which suggests that the `file_path` should be processed through a method (likely for validation or normalization) before being added to the `_assets` dictionary. Additionally, the @@Existing Code does not provide any context or handling for the `file_path` method, which could lead to confusion regarding its purpose and usage. To improve, consider ensuring that the `file_path` is processed appropriately and clarify the role of any external methods or APIs involved in handling file paths.

The existing code does not implement the core functionality described in the docstring, as it lacks the logic to check if the provided path is a zip file and does not utilize the helper functions mentioned in the Oracle Context.

The @@Existing Code has a logical structure but deviates from the @@Correct Code in its handling of the zip file and the way it retrieves and groups the files. First, consider using a context manager with `ZipFile` to ensure the zip file is properly opened and closed, which enhances resource management and prevents potential file access issues.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code correctly implements the functionality described in the docstring, but it could be improved by ensuring that the function signature matches the style of the correct code, specifically by removing the type hint for the return type, which is absent in the correct version. Additionally, consider using a context manager directly in the return statement, as shown in the correct code, to streamline the function and enhance readability. Lastly, ensure that the docstring is formatted consistently, as the correct code includes a more structured example format.

The existing code has several areas for improvement to enhance clarity and functionality. First, consider refining the logic for handling different formats of the `issue` string; for instance, the handling of cases with multiple components could be more explicit to ensure all possible formats are covered, as indicated by the docstring examples. Additionally, the use of more descriptive variable names and comments would improve readability and maintainability, making it easier for future developers to understand the code's intent and logic.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code generally aligns with the docstring's intent but could benefit from improved clarity and consistency in handling variations of "sup" and "spe." For instance, the normalization of the input string could be enhanced by consistently applying case normalization across all checks, which would ensure that variations like "Suppl" and "suppl" are treated uniformly. Additionally, consider refining the logic for handling single and multi-part cases by explicitly defining expected patterns for "sup" and "spe" to avoid ambiguity and ensure all potential formats are accurately captured.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a few areas for improvement to enhance clarity and functionality. First, the use of the `matches_pattern` helper function could be simplified by directly checking for the presence of "sup" or "spe" in the strings, as this would reduce complexity and improve readability. Additionally, the handling of cases with more than three parts is not explicitly addressed, which could lead to unexpected behavior; consider implementing a more robust parsing strategy that systematically evaluates all parts rather than relying on fixed-length conditions. Lastly, ensure that the docstring accurately reflects the function's behavior, particularly regarding how it processes various input formats, to maintain alignment with the intended purpose.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a critical issue with the string concatenation for the return statement; it uses the subtraction operator instead of the multiplication operator for creating the indentation, which will lead to a TypeError. Additionally, the debug details string should be formatted consistently with the correct spacing to ensure clarity in the output.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a critical logical error in the while loop condition for `i`, which should be `i < len(args)` instead of `i == len(args)`, preventing the loop from executing. Additionally, the comparison logic for absorption and negative absorption should utilize membership checks (e.g., `in`) rather than greater-than comparisons, aligning with the intended mathematical laws described in the docstring. Lastly, the handling of `None` should be consistent, using `is None` instead of `> None` to avoid potential type errors and improve clarity.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas that could be improved for clarity and efficiency. Firstly, the initialization of `args` could be simplified by directly assigning `args = list(args) or list(self.args)` to reduce redundancy. Additionally, the condition checks for `j < i` and `j >= i` can be streamlined to enhance readability and maintain consistency, ensuring that the logic for adjusting `i` and `j` is clearer and less error-prone. Finally, consider adding comments to clarify the purpose of complex logic, particularly in the nested loops, to improve maintainability.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a critical issue where the `append()` method is called without passing the `handler` argument, which is necessary for registering the handler correctly in the `self.registry[hook]`. This oversight leads to a failure in functionality as the handler will not be stored, violating the purpose described in the @@Docstring. Additionally, ensure that the `self.registry` is initialized properly to avoid potential key errors when accessing `self.registry[hook]`.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not fully align with the @@Docstring, particularly in the handling of user authentication; it lacks the necessary structure to utilize the `user` parameter effectively, which is crucial for static authentication. Additionally, the configuration for TLS, authentication, and authorization is overly simplistic and does not reflect the complexity indicated in the @@Correct Code, such as the inclusion of multiple authentication strategies and CORS settings. To improve, consider expanding the configuration to incorporate these additional parameters and structures, ensuring that it meets the intended functionality and provides a more robust setup.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not align with the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code in several ways: it lacks comprehensive authentication strategies, such as Keystone and Keycloak, which are present in the correct version, and it uses a simplistic password handling approach that should be replaced with a more secure method. Additionally, the @@Existing Code's structure for the TLS and authorization configurations is overly simplistic and does not include necessary parameters like certificate paths or advanced authorization strategies. To improve the code, consider implementing a more robust authentication mechanism, enhancing the TLS configuration, and ensuring that the authorization settings reflect the intended security model.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not fully align with the @@Docstring, particularly in the structure and naming conventions of the configuration parameters; for instance, the `authentication` section lacks clarity in its representation of strategies and their states. Additionally, the @@Existing Code uses hardcoded values for sensitive information like passwords without any placeholder for secure handling, which is a significant security concern. To improve, consider adopting a more structured approach to configuration that mirrors the @@Correct Code's organization and clarity, ensuring that all parameters are clearly defined and that sensitive data is handled appropriately.

The existing code lacks implementation and does not fulfill the purpose described in the docstring, which is to convert a timezone-aware datetime to a new timezone while handling ambiguity correctly. To improve it, you should incorporate logic that checks for the `utcoffset` and `dst` values of the provided datetime, ensuring that they are not `None`, and handle the potential ambiguity by using the `enfold` function as demonstrated in the correct code. Additionally, consider raising appropriate exceptions, such as `ValueError`, to handle cases where the datetime does not meet the required conditions, ensuring robust error handling.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code correctly implements the intended functionality but could benefit from a few conceptual modifications. Firstly, it should ensure that the handling of ambiguous datetimes aligns with the latest standards, as the current implementation may not account for the nuances introduced by PEP 495 regarding DST assumptions. Additionally, consider simplifying the logic for calculating the new datetime by directly incorporating the adjustments for both UTC and DST offsets, which would enhance clarity and reduce the potential for errors.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code lacks any implementation, simply returning `None`, which does not fulfill the purpose described in the @@Docstring. To improve it, consider incorporating logic that retrieves version information using the APIs listed in the @@Oracle Context, ensuring that error handling is implemented to manage potential exceptions gracefully. Additionally, ensure that the function adheres to the expected output format as demonstrated in the @@Correct Code, providing meaningful version information or default values when necessary.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code lacks the flexibility and configurability present in the @@Correct Code, particularly in how it handles configuration settings and verbosity, which are crucial for debugging and adaptability. Additionally, the error handling could be improved by ensuring that specific exceptions are caught and handled appropriately, rather than falling back to a generic error message, which can obscure the root cause of issues. Finally, the logic for determining the root directory and version information could be streamlined to avoid redundancy and enhance clarity, making the code easier to maintain and understand.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code. Firstly, the handling of the configuration parameter could be streamlined by directly obtaining the configuration settings within the function rather than passing it as an argument, which aligns better with the context provided in the @@Correct Code. Additionally, the error handling could be made more concise by avoiding repetitive return statements for default values, potentially using a single return statement at the end of the function to enhance readability and maintainability.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
To improve the @@Existing Code, consider implementing a default style handling mechanism similar to the @@Correct Code, which sets a default style if none is provided. Additionally, ensure that the code checks for potential errors in the `pieces` dictionary before attempting to access its keys, as this can prevent runtime exceptions. Finally, standardize the error messages for consistency and clarity, aligning them with the format used in the @@Correct Code.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not handle the case where the `pieces` dictionary might contain an "error" key, which is present in the @@Correct Code; this could lead to unhandled exceptions if the input is malformed. Additionally, the @@Existing Code uses a set for required keys but does not provide a default behavior for the `style` parameter, which could lead to inconsistencies when the style is not specified. Lastly, the @@Existing Code raises a generic error message for unknown styles, while the @@Correct Code provides a more informative message, which enhances debugging and user experience.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly checks for the presence of a '+' character by comparing it directly with the value from `pieces.get('closest-tag', '')`, which may lead to unintended behavior if the value contains additional characters. Instead, consider using a containment check (e.g., using `in`) to determine if a '+' exists within the string, as demonstrated in the correct code. Additionally, ensure that the function handles cases where `pieces` might not contain the expected key gracefully, which aligns with the robustness expected in the broader context.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not assert that `commands` is a list, which could lead to unexpected behavior if a string is passed; adding this check would improve robustness. Additionally, the error handling in the existing code is limited to `subprocess.CalledProcessError`, while the @@Correct Code includes handling for `OSError`, which is crucial for capturing command-not-found errors. Finally, the existing implementation uses `subprocess.check_call`, which does not allow capturing output, whereas the @@Correct Code utilizes `subprocess.Popen` to handle both stdout and stderr more flexibly, allowing for better diagnostics and control over command execution.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not assert that `commands` is a list, which could lead to unexpected behavior if a single command is passed. Additionally, it lacks handling for platform-specific requirements, such as hiding the console window on Windows, which is present in the @@Correct Code. Finally, the error handling could be improved by providing more informative feedback when a command fails to execute, rather than just raising an exception without context.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not assert that `commands` is a list, which could lead to unexpected behavior if a single command is passed; consider enforcing this check at the beginning. Additionally, the error handling for `OSError` is less robust than in the @@Correct Code, as it does not account for specific error types like `errno.ENOENT`, which could provide more informative feedback. Finally, the code could benefit from consolidating the command execution logic to reduce redundancy, particularly in how `popen_kwargs` is managed and how the command output is processed.

The @@Existing Code generally aligns with the @@Docstring, but there are a few discrepancies that could be improved for clarity and correctness. First, the `parentdir_prefix` should be set to the string `"None"` instead of the actual `None` value to match the @@Correct Code, which may prevent potential issues when the configuration is used. Additionally, the `versionfile_source` path differs from the @@Correct Code, so ensure that it reflects the intended file location accurately to avoid runtime errors.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not properly implement the functionality described in the @@Docstring, as it lacks the mechanism to store the decorated function in a centralized structure (like `HANDLERS`) for later retrieval or invocation. Additionally, the inner function `wrapper` does not add any additional behavior or functionality, which may not align with the intention of a decorator. To improve the code, consider implementing a storage mechanism for the decorated functions and ensuring that the decorator modifies the behavior of the original function as intended.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code lacks the implementation details necessary for validating the storage root hierarchy, which is crucial for fulfilling the purpose outlined in the @@Docstring.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code could be improved by incorporating logging instead of print statements for warnings, which would provide better control over the output and allow for different logging levels. Additionally, the @@Correct Code suggests using a more streamlined approach to object validation by directly integrating the `Validator` instantiation with its parameters, making the code cleaner and more efficient. Lastly, consider leveraging the `self.object_paths()` method for obtaining directory paths, as this encapsulates the logic for retrieving object paths and enhances code readability and maintainability.

The @@Existing Code lacks clarity in the handling of the `Validator` instantiation and the validation process, as it does not utilize parameters like `lax_digests` or `show_warnings`, which are present in the @@Correct Code and may enhance validation flexibility and feedback. Additionally, the @@Existing Code does not provide feedback on the validation status through logging or printing messages, which could improve user awareness of the validation process.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code lacks the implementation details necessary to fulfill the purpose outlined in the @@Docstring, specifically the creation and initialization of an OCFL storage root. To improve it, you should incorporate logic that checks for the existence of the storage root, handles exceptions appropriately, and includes logging to track the creation process, as demonstrated in the @@Correct Code. Additionally, consider ensuring that any necessary dependencies, such as the `Namaste` class and relevant APIs, are properly utilized to align with the requirements in the @@Oracle Context.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not handle the parent directory structure correctly, as it assumes the root path is valid without checking if the parent directory exists, which could lead to errors when creating the storage root. Additionally, the logging level used for the success message is set to `info`, while the correct code uses `debug`, which may be more appropriate for initial creation logs. Lastly, the existing code lacks the creation of a layout declaration, which is present in the correct code and adds necessary metadata for the OCFL storage root.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code. First, the method of checking for the existence of the storage root could be more robust by utilizing the `open_fs` method to directly interact with the filesystem, rather than relying on string manipulation to determine the parent directory. Additionally, the logging levels used could be adjusted to provide clearer information; for instance, using `logging.info` instead of `logging.debug` for significant events like the creation of the storage root would enhance visibility in the logs. Finally, consider handling specific exceptions rather than a generic `Exception`, which would allow for more precise error reporting and debugging.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few discrepancies compared to the @@Correct Code, particularly in the regex pattern and error messaging. First, the regex in the existing code does not correctly capture versions with multiple digits and leading zeros, which could lead to incorrect parsing; consider simplifying the regex to ensure it captures the entire version number correctly. Additionally, the error messages should be more consistent and descriptive, using a similar format as the correct code to enhance clarity and maintainability.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code, primarily in its handling of inventory validation and digest recording. Firstly, the existing implementation does not account for different digest algorithms used in prior versions, which is crucial for accurate validation and recording of digests; consider incorporating logic to handle varying algorithms as seen in the correct version. Additionally, the existing code lacks structured error logging and detailed checks for file existence and digest mismatches, which could enhance its robustness and clarity, so integrating a more comprehensive logging mechanism and validation checks would be beneficial.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code lacks the necessary logic to determine the type of the path based on the provided docstring, as it simply returns an empty string. To improve it, you should implement the functionality to open the filesystem at the given path, check for the presence of "0=*" Namaste files, and return the appropriate type based on the conditions outlined in the docstring. Additionally, ensure that error handling is robust and informative, as demonstrated in the @@Correct Code, to provide meaningful feedback when the path cannot be accessed or recognized.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code. Firstly, it lacks robust error handling for the filesystem opening process, which could lead to misleading outcomes if the path is invalid; consider implementing a similar strategy to check the parent directory if the initial path fails. Additionally, the logic for processing Namaste files could be streamlined by ensuring that the regex pattern matches the expected format more accurately, as the current implementation may not handle variations effectively. Finally, the error messages returned could be more informative and consistent with the expected outputs outlined in the @@Docstring, enhancing clarity for users encountering issues.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code. First, the error handling could be more robust; it currently only checks for `FileNotFoundError`, while the @@Correct Code handles various filesystem errors and provides clearer feedback when paths cannot be opened. Additionally, the logic for checking the presence of Namaste files could be streamlined by directly returning error messages for specific cases, rather than relying on a series of conditional checks, which would enhance readability and maintainability. Lastly, the regex used to match Namaste file content in the @@Existing Code should be aligned with the @@Correct Code's pattern to ensure accurate type detection.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains several logical errors and inconsistencies compared to the @@Correct Code, particularly in the checks for the presence of fields in the `params['include_fields']`, where it incorrectly uses comparison operators instead of membership checks (e.g., using `<=` instead of `in`). Additionally, the handling of `max_years` is flawed, as it should only update the parameters if `max_years` is greater than zero, which is not reflected in the existing implementation. To improve the code, focus on ensuring that all condition checks align with the intended logic, particularly regarding membership and comparisons, and clarify the conditions under which parameters are added or modified.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code generally aligns with the @@Docstring and @@Oracle Context, but it could benefit from improved readability and maintainability. Consider refactoring the nested conditionals into smaller, well-named helper methods to clarify the logic and reduce complexity, making it easier to understand the purpose of each section.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains several nested functions that could be simplified or removed to enhance readability and maintainability; consider integrating their logic directly into the main function. Additionally, the checks for adding fields to `include_fields` could be streamlined by using a single function that handles both the presence of fields and their addition, reducing redundancy. Lastly, ensure that all updates to `params` are consistent in style and format, as seen in the @@Correct Code, to improve clarity and maintainability.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has several issues compared to the correct code, particularly in how it handles merging nodes and the conditions for identifying duplicates. Firstly, the inner loop should not compare each node with itself, which can lead to unnecessary checks and potential errors; instead, consider using a single pass to track duplicates. Additionally, the use of `deep_merge_nodes()` without passing the correct parameters in the recursive call for merging MappingNodes is incorrect and will result in an error; ensure that the values being merged are properly passed to the function. Lastly, the return statement should ensure that it returns the original node if it is not marked for deletion, rather than using `get()` without a default value.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not fully adhere to the merging logic described in the @@Docstring, particularly in how it handles duplicate keys and non-MappingNode values; it lacks a systematic approach to merging nodes based on their types and does not consider SequenceNodes, which could lead to incorrect behavior. Additionally, the use of a nested loop to compare each node against every other node can lead to inefficiencies, especially with larger datasets, suggesting a need for a more streamlined merging strategy that avoids redundant comparisons. Lastly, the @@Correct Code demonstrates a clearer handling of merging logic and the use of a `replaced_nodes` dictionary, which could be beneficial for maintaining clarity and efficiency in the merging process.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not fully adhere to the merging logic described in the @@Docstring, particularly in how it handles duplicate keys and the merging of values, which could lead to incorrect results when merging `MappingNode` values. Additionally, the approach of using nested loops to compare every node against every other node is inefficient and could be optimized by using a dictionary to track keys and their corresponding values directly, thus avoiding unnecessary comparisons. Lastly, ensure that the handling of non-`MappingNode` values is consistent with the requirement that the last value wins in the case of collisions, which may not be adequately addressed in the existing implementation.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a few discrepancies compared to the correct code and the docstring. Firstly, the help text for the `--source` argument incorrectly states it as "Required" when it should be "Optional," which could mislead users about its necessity. Secondly, the `--overwrite` argument's default value is set to `True`, but it should be `False` to align with the correct code and the docstring's implication that it defaults to not overwriting files. Lastly, the action for `--overwrite` should be `store_true` instead of `store_false`, ensuring that the presence of the flag indicates that overwriting is desired.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code lacks the handling of subparser aliases and does not account for the special case of the "borg" action, which could lead to incorrect parsing behavior as described in the @@Docstring. Additionally, it does not utilize `OrderedDict` for maintaining the order of parsed arguments, which could affect the output structure. To improve, consider integrating alias handling and ensuring that the order of arguments is preserved, as demonstrated in the @@Correct Code.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has several areas for improvement compared to the correct code. First, it lacks a mechanism to handle aliases for subparser names, which could lead to incorrect parsing when users provide alternative names; incorporating an alias mapping would enhance flexibility. Additionally, the logic for removing subparser names from the remaining arguments is not as comprehensive as in the correct code, which could result in leftover subparser names that should be filtered out, potentially causing confusion in subsequent processing. Finally, the handling of the "borg" action is not as robust, as it doesn't account for the possibility of other subparser actions being triggered inadvertently, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

The @@Existing Code has several issues compared to the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. Firstly, it does not handle the special case for the "borg" action correctly, which could lead to confusion in argument parsing; consider implementing a mechanism to prioritize this action as shown in the @@Correct Code. Additionally, the approach to managing remaining arguments could be optimized by directly modifying the `remaining_arguments` list after parsing, rather than iterating through it multiple times, which may lead to inefficiencies and potential errors in argument handling. Lastly, ensure that the use of `SUBPARSER_ALIASES` is consistent and correctly integrated, as it appears to be referenced but not defined in the @@Existing Code.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains several discrepancies compared to the @@Correct Code, particularly in the use of default values and argument requirements. For instance, the `expand_home` parameter in `get_default_config_paths` should be a boolean (`True` or `False`) rather than an integer, and the `add_help` parameter should be set to `False` instead of `1` for the global parser and subparsers. Additionally, the choices for the verbosity arguments should be adjusted to match the ranges provided in the correct implementation, which would enhance clarity and maintain consistency with the expected behavior outlined in the docstring.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code. Firstly, the default values for verbosity-related arguments in the global parser should be set to `0` instead of `1`, aligning with the correct implementation and ensuring consistency in user experience. Additionally, the `--bash-completion` and `--version` arguments should explicitly set their default values to `False`, which enhances clarity and prevents potential issues when these flags are not provided. Lastly, consider consolidating repetitive patterns in argument definitions to improve maintainability and readability.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code generally adheres to the @@Docstring and @@Oracle Context, but there are several areas for improvement. First, consider using consistent formatting for argument groups and parser definitions, as seen in the @@Correct Code, which enhances readability and maintainability; for instance, breaking long lines and using multi-line arguments can improve clarity. Additionally, ensure that all subparsers have a consistent structure, including the use of aliases, which appears to be missing in some subparser definitions in the @@Existing Code, potentially leading to inconsistencies in user experience.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not fully align with the @@Docstring, as it does not handle the merging of nodes in the specified tuple format, particularly with respect to the expected structure of `ScalarNode` and `MappingNode`. Additionally, the logic for merging values is overly complex and may lead to inefficiencies, as it compares every node with every other node, which could be optimized by using a dictionary to group nodes by their keys first. Lastly, the handling of non-MappingNode values is not explicitly addressed in the merging logic, which is crucial for ensuring that the last value wins when there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not fully adhere to the @@Docstring's requirement for handling non-MappingNode values, as it only merges MappingNodes and does not account for the last value winning for non-MappingNode collisions, which is explicitly stated in the docstring. Additionally, the merging logic in @@Existing Code could be optimized by avoiding the nested loop for comparing nodes, which may lead to performance issues with larger datasets; instead, consider using a dictionary to track keys and their corresponding values directly. Lastly, ensure that the conversion back to the expected format is consistent with the output structure described in the docstring, particularly regarding how merged nodes are represented.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not align with the docstring, as it fails to define specific command-line arguments and does not return parsed arguments; instead, it only returns an `ArgumentParser` instance. To improve, you should explicitly define the expected arguments, including their options and defaults, as shown in the correct code. Additionally, ensure that the function returns the results of `parser.parse_args(arguments)` to fulfill the purpose of parsing and returning the command-line arguments as intended.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not align with the @@Docstring, as it suggests returning an `ArgumentParser` instance, but it actually returns the parsed arguments instead. Additionally, the way arguments are added using tuples may lead to confusion and errors, as it does not directly utilize the expected keyword arguments for `add_argument`. To improve clarity and functionality, consider restructuring the argument addition to use explicit keyword arguments and ensure that the function's return type matches the description in the docstring.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code lacks the handling of global flags and subcommands as seen in the @@Correct Code, which could lead to incomplete bash completions. Additionally, the @@Existing Code does not include a version check mechanism, which is important for ensuring users have the latest completion script. Lastly, consider improving the readability and maintainability of the completion script generation by breaking down complex string formatting into clearer, more structured components.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code lacks a clear separation of concerns, as it mixes the creation of the parser with the parsing of arguments, which can lead to difficulties in maintenance and testing; consider refactoring to create a dedicated function for setting up the parser. Additionally, the validation logic in `parse_subparser_arguments` could be enhanced to provide more informative error messages and to handle unexpected cases more gracefully. Finally, ensure that the global arguments are correctly integrated into the return structure, as the @@Correct Code suggests a more comprehensive handling of global and subcommand arguments.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not utilize `collections.OrderedDict` for maintaining the order of parsed arguments, which could lead to inconsistencies when processing subparser arguments, as indicated in the @@Correct Code. Additionally, the logic for handling common arguments and the special case for the "borg" action is not clearly defined, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when multiple subparsers are involved. Lastly, the @@Existing Code lacks a mechanism to handle aliases for subparser names, which is crucial for ensuring that common arguments are parsed correctly across different subparsers, as highlighted in the @@Correct Code.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several issues compared to the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. Firstly, it does not handle shared arguments across subparsers effectively, which is a key requirement mentioned in the docstring; implementing a mechanism to manage common arguments would enhance its functionality. Additionally, the logic for managing remaining arguments is less efficient and could lead to incorrect results, as it lacks the structured approach seen in the @@Correct Code, which uses a more systematic way of parsing and handling unused arguments. Lastly, the @@Existing Code does not account for the special case of the "borg" action correctly, which could lead to unexpected behavior when that action is invoked.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code deviates from the @@Correct Code in several key areas, particularly in the handling of argument defaults and actions. For instance, the `add_help` parameter is set to `True` instead of `False` for the `global_parser`, which contradicts the original design intent, and the verbosity levels have been expanded incorrectly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the use of `action='store_false'` for the `--dry-run` option is inconsistent with the expected behavior, which should allow for a dry run when specified, suggesting a need for a review of the intended functionality against the docstring and correct implementation.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code deviates from the @@Correct Code in several key areas, particularly in the handling of argument choices and the use of the `Extend_action` class. Specifically, the argument choices for verbosity levels should range from -1 to 3 instead of 0 to 3, and the `Extend_action` should be correctly referenced instead of `Extend_action`. Additionally, ensure that the help messages and default values align with the intended functionality as described in the docstring and correct code.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has inconsistencies with the correct code, particularly in the use of the `collect` module, where it should be imported correctly, and the `ExtendAction` class should be renamed to match the correct naming convention (`Extend_action`). Additionally, the argument choices for verbosity options should be adjusted to match the correct ranges specified in the correct code (i.e., `range(-1, 3)` instead of `range(-1, 4)`). These changes will ensure adherence to the expected functionality and improve code clarity.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly limits the number of iterations to a fixed range of 5, which does not account for the actual length of the `response` list, potentially leading to incomplete pagination. Instead, you should implement a loop that continues until all items in the `response` have been yielded, using a condition based on the length of the `response`. Additionally, the increment of `i` is redundant since it is already being handled in the loop structure, so simplifying this logic will enhance clarity and maintainability.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not handle cases where the size string may not end with a recognized unit, which could lead to a KeyError when accessing the `units` dictionary. Additionally, the existing code assumes binary units (e.g., 'K' = 1024), while the correct code uses decimal units (e.g., 'K' = 1000), which aligns better with the docstring's examples. Lastly, the correct code includes a check for valid units using `endswith`, improving robustness by avoiding potential errors with malformed input.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not handle all potential units (e.g., P, E, Z, Y) as shown in the correct code, which could lead to incorrect conversions for larger sizes. Additionally, the code assumes the last character is always the unit, which may fail if the size includes more than one character for the magnitude (e.g., "500K" vs. "5K"). Lastly, consider adding error handling for invalid inputs to enhance robustness and user experience.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly modifies the expected output by adding 1 to each value during the summation process, which diverges from the behavior described in the docstring and the correct code. Additionally, the docstring indicates that the function should combine values without mutation, but the implementation does not clarify how it handles missing keys in subsequent dictionaries, which could lead to a KeyError. To improve the code, ensure that values are summed correctly without unintended increments and consider using `dict.get(k, 0)` to handle missing keys gracefully.

The existing code contains unnecessary type checks for the `url` and `url_args` parameters, which could be omitted if the function is guaranteed to be called with the correct types, as implied by the docstring.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly returns a comma-separated string of argument flags instead of the space-separated string as specified in the docstring. To align with the docstring, you should modify the string joining method from `', '` to `' '` in the return statement. Additionally, consider using the public API of `argparse` instead of accessing the private attribute `_actions`, which enhances code maintainability and adheres to best practices.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a logical flaw in handling the last vertex of the polygon; it should wrap around to the first vertex instead of the last one when accessing the next vertex. Additionally, the error handling with the `try-except` block can be avoided by using modular arithmetic to calculate the indices, which would make the code cleaner and more efficient.

The existing code has a few areas for improvement to align it more closely with the docstring and correct code. First, the handling of padding could be simplified; rather than modifying the number based on padding, consider directly calculating the required padding after generating the output to maintain clarity. Additionally, using a string concatenation approach (as seen in the correct code) instead of a list for `output` can enhance performance and readability, especially since strings are immutable in Python. Lastly, ensure that the function consistently checks for non-negative integers at the beginning, as this is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the input.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not include error handling for cases where `register_value` may not exist in `flow_params`, which can lead to a `KeyError`. Additionally, it directly assigns the value to `flow_params[register_number]` without formatting the register number, which deviates from the correct code's intention to use a specific naming convention (e.g., 'reg1', 'reg2'). Lastly, the function lacks a return statement, which is present in the correct code, potentially limiting its usability in broader contexts.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code generally follows the intent described in the docstring, but it could be improved in terms of error handling and clarity. Instead of raising a KeyError when the `register_value` is not found, consider using a try-except block to handle this gracefully, which would align with the behavior of the correct code and avoid abrupt termination. Additionally, using `str.format()` for formatting the register key instead of an f-string could enhance consistency with the correct code, as it demonstrates a different approach to string formatting that may be preferred in some contexts.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code generally aligns with the docstring but could benefit from improved error handling and clarity. Instead of using a generic exception handler, consider specifically catching `KeyError` to handle cases where `register_value` is not found, which would make the code more robust and informative. Additionally, the warning message could be enhanced by raising a custom exception or logging the error instead of printing, which would provide better integration with external systems or logging frameworks.

Additionally, using `alphabet.index(char)` within the loop can be inefficient, especially for long strings or large alphabets, as it performs a linear search each time; consider using a dictionary for faster lookups. Lastly, ensure that the code handles cases where characters in the string may not be present in the alphabet, as this could raise an error.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few issues that can be improved for clarity and correctness. First, the `mkdir` method's parameters should use `True` instead of `2` for `parents` and `exist_ok`, as these are boolean flags, which enhances readability and correctness. Additionally, the extraction path should be derived from `split(".tar.gz")[0]` instead of `[1]`, ensuring that the directory is correctly named based on the original file name. Lastly, consider using a context manager for opening the tar file to ensure it is properly closed even if an error occurs during extraction.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a couple of issues: it uses `sys.platform` instead of the more appropriate `platform.system()`, which is better suited for this check, and it incorrectly returns `True` or `False` using a conditional expression, which can be simplified to just return the boolean expression directly. Additionally, the function lacks an import statement for the `platform` module, which is necessary for the code to function correctly. To improve the code, ensure to use the correct method for OS detection and simplify the return statement for clarity.

The existing code has several issues that deviate from the docstring and correct code. First, the assertion for `isinstance(name)` is incomplete; it should specify the expected type (e.g., `bytes`). Additionally, the `unquoted_char` function lacks proper handling of the `match` object, particularly in the `len()` and `int()` calls, which should reference `match.group()` to extract the matched string. Lastly, the parameters in the `re.sub` function call are incorrect; the flags should not include an arbitrary number (like `87`), and the regex pattern should be correctly formatted without unnecessary flags.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several issues compared to the @@Correct Code, particularly in the way the platform is determined and how the regular expression is defined. First, the condition for setting the platform should check for equality with 'this' instead of being less than, as this could lead to incorrect platform detection. Additionally, the use of `>= None` should be replaced with `is not None` for clarity and correctness, as the former can lead to unexpected behavior in Python. Lastly, ensure that the regular expression is defined as a raw string (using `r''`) to avoid unintended escape sequence processing.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code. First, the regex patterns for command splitting could be simplified by using raw string literals consistently, which enhances readability and reduces the risk of escaping errors. Additionally, the error messages should be consistent in spelling (e.g., "unknown" instead of "unkown") to maintain clarity and professionalism in the code's output. Lastly, consider adding type hints for the function parameters and return type to improve code clarity and facilitate better integration with type-checking tools.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few issues that could be improved for better functionality and adherence to the @@Docstring. Firstly, it lacks error handling for cases where the `archive_path` does not exist, which is explicitly mentioned in the docstring; implementing a check for the file's existence before attempting to uncompress it would enhance robustness. Additionally, the subprocess command incorrectly uses "xz" instead of "xf" for extracting the archive, which could lead to runtime errors; ensuring the correct flags are used is crucial for the intended functionality. Lastly, the conditional for setting `_fname` could be simplified by directly using the truthiness of `filename`, which aligns with Pythonic practices.

The existing code has a few areas for improvement: First, ensure that the `capture_output` and `text` parameters are set to `True` instead of `2` for better readability and to match the correct usage in the `subprocess.run` method. Second, the code does not sort the list of ignored files as specified in the docstring; consider adding a sorting step before joining the filenames.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code fails to handle time units like "weeks", "months", and "years", which are mentioned in the @@Docstring but not implemented, leading to potential parsing errors. Additionally, it lacks normalization of the input string (e.g., stripping whitespace and converting to lowercase), which could result in mismatches when checking the frequency value. Finally, the error messages could be more informative by including the original input string, aiding debugging when a ValueError is raised.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code. First, it lacks a check for the "always" string after normalizing the input, which could lead to unnecessary processing; consider moving this check earlier. Additionally, the @@Existing Code does not handle pluralization of time units effectively, which could lead to errors when parsing; implementing a check to ensure time units are pluralized would enhance robustness. Lastly, the @@Correct Code uses a more concise approach with a dictionary unpacking method for creating the `timedelta`, which simplifies the logic and reduces repetitive code.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a few issues compared to the correct code: it redundantly checks for "always" twice, which can be streamlined, and it lacks a robust error handling mechanism for parsing the frequency string, particularly when the split operation fails. Additionally, the handling of time units could be improved by directly converting "months" to "weeks" and "years" to "days" within the same conditional structure to avoid unnecessary dictionary lookups. Lastly, the code should ensure that it raises a `ValueError` with a more informative message when an invalid time unit is encountered, enhancing the clarity of error reporting.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains a few issues that can be improved for clarity and correctness. First, the regex pattern used in the `re.compile` function should be defined with a raw string (prefix `r`) to avoid potential issues with escape sequences, which is correctly done in the @@Correct Code. Additionally, the `return` statement in the @@Existing Code unnecessarily includes the number `29`, which does not align with the intended output as described in the docstring and the @@Correct Code; this should be removed to ensure the function returns only the transformed tuple of paths.

The existing code has a couple of issues that need addressing.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly checks the condition for overwriting the file, as it will return `FileExistsError` even when `overwrite` is `True`, which contradicts the intended behavior described in the docstring. Additionally, instead of returning an error, it would be more appropriate to raise the `FileExistsError` to properly signal an exception when the file exists and overwriting is not allowed. Lastly, consider adding a more informative message to the raised exception to guide users on how to proceed if they encounter this error.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code correctly implements the functionality described in the @@Docstring, but there are a few areas for improvement. First, instead of raising a `FileExistsError`, consider returning a status or logging the error to provide more flexibility in handling the situation without abruptly terminating the program. Additionally, the exception handling for `os.makedirs` could be refined to only catch `FileNotFoundError`, as catching `FileExistsError` may mask legitimate issues with directory creation. Lastly, ensure that the file is opened in binary mode if the content could include non-text data, which is not addressed in the @@Correct Code.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a few issues that could be improved for clarity and functionality. First, the `sys` and `os` modules are used without being imported, which will lead to a `NameError`; ensure that all necessary modules are imported at the beginning of the file. Additionally, the command passed to `subprocess.run` may not correctly handle the `*args` due to its placement; consider restructuring how arguments are passed to ensure they are appropriately included in the command string. Lastly, the timeout parameter should be explicitly defined in the function signature to maintain consistency with the docstring and ensure proper usage.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a few discrepancies compared to the correct code and the docstring. First, the use of `matcher.get()` does not align with the correct code's use of `matcher.group()`, which suggests that `matcher` should be a regex match object rather than a dictionary; this needs clarification in the docstring. Additionally, the error message in the existing code lacks the proper formatting for the variable name, which could lead to confusion, so consider enhancing the error message for better clarity. Lastly, ensure that the function signature matches the expected input type, as the docstring implies a specific structure for `matcher`.

The @@Existing Code has a few discrepancies compared to the @@Correct Code and the @@Docstring. Firstly, the `strip` parameter defaults to `False` instead of `True`, which may lead to unexpected behavior if the intention is to always strip whitespace by default. Secondly, the type checks use `isinstance` for `re.Pattern`, while the @@Correct Code uses `type()`, which is less flexible; consider using `isinstance` for consistency and future-proofing. Lastly, the regex pattern compilation in the @@Existing Code appends a dollar sign (`$`), which may not be necessary unless you specifically want to match the end of the string, so ensure that this behavior aligns with the intended functionality.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several issues that deviate from the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. Firstly, the assertion statement incorrectly checks `isinstance(list)` instead of `isinstance(commands, list)`, which could lead to runtime errors. Additionally, the command execution logic does not include the `args` parameter when constructing the command list for `subprocess.Popen`, which is crucial for passing arguments to the command being executed. Lastly, the error handling and output messages could be improved for clarity and completeness, particularly by including the standard output when an error occurs.

The existing code initializes `roots` with all subjects from the graph, which may not accurately reflect the intended behavior of finding roots in a hierarchy, as it doesn't account for the absence of parents. Additionally, the logic for updating `roots` and `non_roots` could be streamlined to ensure that only nodes without parents are retained as roots, aligning more closely with the correct code's approach. Lastly, consider explicitly defining the type of `non_roots` to enhance clarity and maintain consistency with the type hints used throughout the function.

The existing code has a couple of issues compared to the correct code: it incorrectly passes `13` as the second argument to `yaml.dump` in the Python 3 case, which should be omitted, and it also fails to pass `obj` in the Python 2 case, which is necessary for proper functionality. To improve the code, ensure that the parameters align with the expected arguments of the `yaml.dump` function for both Python versions, and verify that the logic correctly handles the differences between Python 2 and Python 3. Additionally, consider adding error handling to manage potential exceptions during the dumping process, enhancing robustness.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several discrepancies compared to the @@Correct Code and the @@Docstring. Firstly, the logger's level is set to `logging.ERROR`, which contradicts the intent of a debugging logger; it should reflect the `debug` parameter to toggle between `DEBUG` and `INFO` levels based on a settings configuration. Additionally, the maximum bytes for the log file is set to 5 MB instead of the 10 MB specified in the correct version, which may lead to more frequent log rotations than necessary. Lastly, consider moving the log directory and the logging level to a configuration settings module to enhance flexibility and maintainability.

The @@Existing Code correctly implements a logger but has a hardcoded debug level that does not align with the @@Correct Code, which suggests using a settings-based approach for determining the logging level.

The existing code generally aligns with the docstring's purpose but could benefit from a few improvements. Firstly, consider making the log level configurable based on a debug flag or a settings variable to enhance flexibility, as seen in the correct code. Additionally, while the existing code correctly creates the log directory, it could simplify the directory creation logic by using `os.makedirs(logdir, exist_ok=True)` without the need for a separate existence check.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code correctly implements the Gaussian function, but it includes unnecessary complexity by calculating both the coefficient and the exponent separately, which is not present in the @@Correct Code. Additionally, the @@Correct Code simplifies the return statement, making it more concise and easier to read, which aligns better with best practices for clarity and maintainability. Consider streamlining your implementation by focusing on the essential elements of the Gaussian function as shown in the @@Correct Code.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not align with the @@Docstring in that it fails to return `logging.LogRecord` instances for parse errors, instead only appending exceptions to an error log. Additionally, it does not utilize the `overrides` and `resolve_env` parameters, which are mentioned in the docstring and should be part of the configuration loading process. Lastly, the @@Correct Code employs `collections.OrderedDict` for maintaining order and uses `logging.makeLogRecord` for structured logging, which enhances error handling and should be incorporated into the existing implementation.

The @@Existing Code does not fully align with the @@Docstring, particularly in how it handles exceptions and logs errors; it should specifically account for `PermissionError` and other exceptions like `ValueError`, `OSError`, and `validate.Validation_error`, which are addressed in the @@Correct Code. Additionally, the logging level and messages in the error handling could be improved for clarity and specificity, as seen in the @@Correct Code, which provides more informative log entries. Lastly, ensure that the configuration parsing function is called with the appropriate parameters, as the @@Existing Code lacks the structured approach of the @@Correct Code in invoking `parse_configuration`.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few discrepancies when compared to the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. Firstly, the error handling for `PermissionError` and other exceptions does not provide the same level of detail or logging severity as the correct implementation, which uses `WARNING` and `CRITICAL` levels respectively; consider adjusting the log levels to better reflect the severity of the issues. Additionally, the @@Existing Code uses `parse_configuration` with a file object, while the @@Correct Code directly passes the filename and other parameters, which may lead to incorrect parsing; ensure that the function signature and parameters align with the expected usage. Finally, the error messages in the @@Existing Code could be more informative by including the specific error encountered, similar to the @@Correct Code's approach.

The existing code contains a logical error in the conditional statement, where the use of `>= True` and `!= True` is unnecessary and can lead to confusion; instead, use `== True` for clarity. Additionally, the docstring states that the function should return a bytes object when `obj` is a string, but the existing code incorrectly attempts to decode when `obj` is of type `numpy.bytes_` or `bytes`, which should be the opposite. To align with the correct code, ensure that the function only decodes when `obj` is a string type, and return the original object otherwise.

Additionally, the use of `isinstance` checks in the correct code suggests a need to account for both `numpy.bytes_` and standard `bytes`, ensuring compatibility with various data types. To improve the function, consider implementing checks for these types and adjusting the return logic to decode bytes back into a string when appropriate.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a logical inconsistency with the docstring and the intended functionality; it should only return a bytes object if the input is a string, but it also returns the input unchanged if it is neither a string nor bytes, which is not aligned with the docstring's implication of transforming the input. Additionally, the use of `isinstance` checks could be simplified by combining conditions, and the check for `numpy.bytes_` should be prioritized to maintain clarity and ensure compatibility with the numpy library. Lastly, the function could benefit from explicit handling of unexpected input types, potentially raising an error or returning a specific value to indicate invalid input.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code lacks the implementation details necessary to fulfill the requirements outlined in the @@Docstring, particularly the validation of the `ticks` parameter and the creation of a `Time` object. To improve it, ensure that you include type checks for `ticks`, raise appropriate exceptions for out-of-bounds values, and implement the logic to convert `ticks` into hours, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds using the provided constants and functions. Additionally, consider how the timezone (`tz`) parameter will be integrated into the `Time` object creation to align with the @@Oracle Context.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few discrepancies compared to the @@Correct Code and @@Docstring. Firstly, the error message for the `TypeError` should be more consistent with the capitalization used in the @@Correct Code for clarity. Secondly, the conversion of ticks to hours, minutes, and seconds could be streamlined by directly using the `__new__` method of the `Time` class instead of creating a `datetime.time` object, which would better align with the intended return type as specified in the docstring. Lastly, the bounds check for `ticks` could be simplified by combining the checks into a single conditional statement, improving readability and maintainability.

The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement to align more closely with the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. First, the error messages should be consistent in capitalization and clarity; for example, "ticks must be an integer" could be improved to "Ticks must be int" for uniformity with the @@Correct Code. Additionally, the logic for unpacking the ticks into hours, minutes, and seconds could be simplified by directly using the variable names as shown in the @@Correct Code, which enhances readability and reduces potential confusion. Lastly, ensure that the call to `cls.__new__` includes the correct parameters, as the existing code uses `tzinfo` incorrectly; it should be passed as a keyword argument.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few issues that deviate from the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. Firstly, the check for `protocol_version != None` should be `protocol_version is None` to align with Python's best practices for checking `None`. Secondly, the logic for returning a specific protocol handler is incorrect; it should verify if `protocol_version` exists in the `handlers` dictionary rather than using a comparison with `handlers`. Lastly, consider improving code readability by using consistent formatting and grouping related imports, as seen in the @@Correct Code.

The @@Existing Code correctly validates input types and encodes strings but lacks clarity in error messages and does not utilize the `frozenset` to store validated values, which is a key aspect of the @@Correct Code.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code correctly checks the type of `values` and validates each string, but it could benefit from simplifying the error messages for clarity and consistency with the @@Correct Code. Additionally, the @@Existing Code uses a set to store validated values, which is unnecessary since the final output is a `frozenset`, and using a list (as in the @@Correct Code) would be more straightforward for appending values. Lastly, consider renaming the `_values` attribute to `_raw_values` for better alignment with the context provided in the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code.

The @@Existing Code does not fully implement the logic described in the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code, as it only returns the input sequence and its type without any checks or transformations based on the sequence's actual type.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code largely adheres to the @@Docstring, but there are a few areas for improvement. First, the calculation of `rescale` should ensure that it does not inadvertently introduce a division by zero error; consider validating `self._scale` before performing the division. Additionally, the comment about Python 2 support could be updated or removed if the codebase has transitioned to Python 3, as it may no longer be relevant and could lead to confusion. Lastly, consider enhancing the readability of the code by simplifying the logic where possible, such as directly using `self._get_err_indices(last_coord_name)` without needing to create a separate variable for `last_coord_indices`.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several issues that deviate from the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. Firstly, the handling of `field_names` should ensure that it is properly converted from a string to a tuple only when necessary, as seen in the @@Correct Code, which also includes a regex pattern that might be more robust. Secondly, the while loops for processing coordinates and graph values are incorrectly structured; they should be replaced with a for loop that iterates over the bins, as demonstrated in the @@Correct Code, which enhances clarity and efficiency. Lastly, the error handling for `get_coordinate` should ensure that it raises a clear error message, which is already well-implemented in the @@Correct Code, providing better feedback to the user.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement based on the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. Firstly, consider allowing `get_coordinate` to be a callable function for greater flexibility, as this could accommodate more complex coordinate calculations if needed in the future. Additionally, the handling of `make_value` could be reconsidered; instead of relying on it to transform values, it might be beneficial to allow for more direct manipulation of graph data, which could simplify the graph creation process and enhance performance by avoiding unnecessary transformations. Lastly, ensure that the iteration over `coords` and `graph_value` is clear and efficient, potentially using more descriptive variable names to enhance readability.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code. First, the handling of the `get_coordinate` parameter could be more streamlined; consider ensuring that it can accept callable functions from the start, as this enhances flexibility and usability. Additionally, the logic for appending values to `coords` could be simplified by directly zipping `coords` with the combined `coord` and `graph_value`, which would eliminate the need for the conditional check on the index and improve readability. Lastly, ensure that the error messages are consistent and informative, as they play a crucial role in debugging and user experience.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code. Firstly, the method of collecting metaclasses could be simplified by using a list comprehension, which enhances readability and conciseness. Additionally, the error handling for incompatible metaclasses could be more informative; instead of a generic TypeError, consider providing context about the conflicting bases to aid debugging. Lastly, ensure that the handling of classic classes is clear and consistent with the Python version being used, as this can lead to confusion in environments where both classic and new-style classes may exist.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code correctly implements the basic functionality of the `pop` method, but it diverges from the @@Correct Code in its handling of the `default` value and the way it accesses the dictionary. Instead of directly accessing `self.__dict__`, consider using `self` to leverage any potential custom behavior defined in the class, which could enhance maintainability and encapsulation.

The existing code has inconsistencies in handling the frequency of items to be popped, as it incorrectly uses `most_common(2)` in one instance, while the docstring specifies returning the least frequently used item, which should be `most_common(1)`.

The existing code for the `popitem` method is incorrect as it recursively calls itself, leading to infinite recursion instead of implementing the intended functionality of removing and returning the least recently used `(key, value)` pair.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code correctly implements the functionality described in the docstring, but it can be improved for clarity and efficiency. First, consider using `self.__order[0]` to directly access the least recently used key instead of creating an iterator, which simplifies the logic and avoids unnecessary overhead. Additionally, the error message in the exception could be made more informative by including the type of the object, as shown in the correct code, to enhance debugging and user experience.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code correctly implements the basic functionality of removing and returning the most recently used key-value pair, but it lacks error handling for the empty dictionary case, which is better managed in the @@Correct Code through a `try-except` block. Additionally, the @@Correct Code uses `iter(self.__order)` to ensure that the order of items is preserved, which is crucial for maintaining the expected behavior of a data structure that relies on insertion order. To improve the @@Existing Code, consider implementing a similar approach to handle empty states more gracefully and ensure that the order of items is respected.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not fulfill the docstring's requirement to remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair, as it only calls the `__choice` method without handling the key-value relationship or potential errors. To align with the docstring, you should ensure that the method retrieves a key using `__choice`, checks if the collection is empty to avoid errors, and then returns the corresponding key-value pair. Additionally, consider implementing error handling to raise a `KeyError` if the collection is empty, as indicated in the correct code.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly removes the `self._in_obj.param_regex` from `regex_parts`, which contradicts the intended functionality of creating a regular expression that includes this parameter.

To improve the code, ensure that all necessary regex components are included and that the conditions accurately reflect the intended logic as described in the docstring.

First, ensure that the handling of escape characters is robust by validating that `self._in_obj.escape_regex` and `self._in_obj.param_regex` are correctly formatted and do not introduce unintended patterns.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code contains unnecessary error handling that complicates the logic without providing significant benefit, such as catching exceptions when accessing attributes or formatting strings; instead, you should ensure that these attributes are valid before using them. Additionally, the regex pattern for `out_percent` has an extra closing parenthesis that should be removed to match the @@Correct Code. Lastly, consider logging errors instead of printing them directly, as this would be more appropriate for production-level code.

The existing code lacks the comprehensive type checks and converter class determination present in the correct code, which leads to potential runtime errors if unexpected types are encountered. Additionally, the use of `assert` statements in the correct code provides a more efficient way to validate conditions without raising exceptions unnecessarily, while also ensuring that the necessary attributes are checked before proceeding.

    An ISO-8601 datetime string consists of a date portion, followed

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several issues that deviate from the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. First, the use of `len()` and `datetime()` without arguments is incorrect; instead, you should use `len(dt_str)` and `datetime(*components)` to properly handle the parsed components. Additionally, the error message in the `ValueError` should not include a numeric code, as it does not align with typical Python error handling practices and lacks clarity. Lastly, ensure that the handling of the midnight case (24:00) correctly increments the date by one day, as indicated in the @@Docstring.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement. Firstly, the handling of the time component when `components[3]` equals 24 should ensure that the timezone information is included in the return statement, as it is present in the `components` list; this is crucial for accurate datetime representation. Additionally, the code could benefit from clearer error handling or logging to provide more informative feedback when encountering unknown ISO components, enhancing maintainability and debugging.

either a dot or a comma.


.. caution::

    Support for fractional components other than seconds is part of the
    ISO-8601 standard, but is not currently implemented in this parser.

Supported time zone offset formats are:

- `Z` (UTC)
- `±HH:MM`
- `±HHMM`
- `±HH`

Offsets will be represented as :class:`dateutil.tz.tzoffset` objects,
with the exception of UTC, which will be represented as
:class:`dateutil.tz.tzutc`. Time zone offsets equivalent to UTC (such
as `+00:00`) will also be represented as :class:`dateutil.tz.tzutc`.

:param dt_str:
    A string or stream containing only an ISO-8601 datetime string

:return:
    Returns a :class:`datetime.datetime` representing the string.
    Unspecified components default to their lowest value.

.. warning::

    As of version 2.7.0, the strictness of the parser should not be
    considered a stable part of the contract. Any valid ISO-8601 string
    that parses correctly with the default settings will continue to
    parse correctly in future versions, but invalid strings that
    currently fail (e.g. ``2017-01-01T00:00+00:00:00``) are not
    guaranteed to continue failing in future versions if they encode
    a valid date.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code appears to have a few discrepancies when compared to the docstring and the correct code. Firstly, the handling of the `components` list when creating the `datetime` object should ensure that the timezone information is correctly included, as seen in the correct code. Additionally, the check for the special case of midnight (where `hh` is `24`) should be more explicit in its handling of the timezone, ensuring that the timezone is applied correctly after adjusting the hour. Lastly, the code could benefit from clearer error handling to provide more informative feedback when the input string does not conform to expected formats.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

    Parse an ISO-8601 datetime string into a :class:`datetime.datetime`.

    An ISO-8601 datetime string consists of a date portion, followed
    optionally by a time portion - the date and time portions are separated
    by a single character separator, which is ``T`` in the official
    standard. Incomplete date formats (such as ``YYYY-MM``) may *not* be
    combined with a time portion.

    Supported date formats are:

    Common:

    - ``YYYY``
    - ``YYYY-MM`` or ``YYYYMM``
    - ``YYYY-MM-DD`` or ``YYYYMMDD``

    Uncommon:

    - ``YYYY-Www`` or ``YYYYWww`` - ISO week (day defaults to 0)
    - ``YYYY-Www-D`` or ``YYYYWwwD`` - ISO week and day

    The ISO week and day numbering follows the same logic as
    :func:`datetime.date.isocalendar`.

    Supported time formats are:

    - ``hh``
    - ``hh:mm`` or ``hhmm``
    - ``hh:mm:ss`` or ``hhmmss``
    - ``hh:mm:ss.ssssss`` (Up to 6 sub-second digits)

    Midnight is a special case for `hh`, as the standard supports both
    00:00 and 24:00 as a representation. The decimal separator can be
    either a dot or a comma.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several issues that deviate from the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. Firstly, the call to `len()` is incorrect as it should be applied to a variable (likely `res`), and the error messages in the `raise ParserError` calls should include the `timestr` for clarity. Additionally, the logic for building the naive and timezone-aware datetime objects is inconsistent with the correct implementation, particularly in how parameters are passed to `_build_naive` and `_build_tzaware`, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code and @@Docstring. Firstly, the error messages in the `ParserError` raises should use formatted strings instead of concatenation for clarity and consistency, ensuring that the error messages are more readable and maintainable. Secondly, the call to `_build_tzaware` should include `res` as an argument, which is necessary for correctly processing the timezone-aware datetime if `ignoretz` is `False`. Lastly, consider explicitly checking if `timestr` is a string at the beginning to raise a `TypeError` early, improving the robustness of the function.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code. First, the error handling for `ParserError` should use formatted strings for consistency, ensuring the messages are clear and informative; this can enhance debugging. Additionally, the handling of the `ret` variable when `ignoretz` is `False` should ensure that the `res` variable is passed to `_build_tzaware`, as this is crucial for proper timezone handling. Lastly, consider validating the `default` parameter to ensure it is a `datetime` object before using it, which aligns with the docstring's description of its expected behavior.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly sets the `fold` parameter in the `enfold` function by negating the `_fold` status, which contradicts the logic described in the docstring and the correct code. To improve the code, ensure that the fold status accurately reflects whether the datetime is in a "fold" state by directly using `_fold` instead of its negation.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not fully align with the @@Docstring, as it incorrectly handles the case where the datetime is already aware; it should return the datetime unchanged if it has a timezone, rather than checking for `utcoffset`. Additionally, the `tzinfo` parameter should be explicitly typed as `tzinfo` to enhance clarity and maintain consistency with the @@Correct Code. Lastly, consider using `dt.replace(tzinfo=tzinfo)` only when `dt` is naive, as this is the intended behavior described in the docstring.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code's logic for identifying a Diaspora request is mostly sound, but it could benefit from a more generalized exception handling approach, as seen in the @@Correct Code, which uses `Exception` instead of specific exceptions. This change would ensure that any unforeseen errors during parsing are gracefully handled, allowing the function to continue checking other formats without interruption. Additionally, consider adding logging for the exceptions to aid in debugging and understanding failures during the request identification process.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not utilize the `decode_if_bytes` and `json.loads` functions as indicated in the Oracle Context, which could lead to issues when handling the request body, especially if it is in a byte format or not properly structured as JSON. Additionally, the current implementation of `identify_request` lacks error handling, which is crucial for robust code, especially when dealing with external data sources. To align with the correct code, consider incorporating these functions and adding exception handling to ensure the function can gracefully manage unexpected input formats.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a potential issue with the way it handles the request body; it directly accesses `request.body` without ensuring it is properly decoded, which could lead to errors if the body is not in the expected format. Additionally, the error handling in `identify_request` could be improved by avoiding broad exceptions and instead catching specific ones, as seen in the @@Correct Code, which enhances clarity and debugging. Finally, consider removing the redundant `else` statement since the `if` condition already returns a value, streamlining the logic for better readability.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement: first, it directly accesses `request.body` without ensuring that it is properly decoded, which could lead to errors if the body is in bytes; consider decoding it before checking for 'events'. Additionally, the exception handling in `identify_request` could be more specific to avoid masking other potential issues, as the @@Correct Code suggests using a broader exception handling strategy while still focusing on the relevant errors. Lastly, the function could benefit from returning `False` explicitly after the try-except block, which would enhance clarity and maintain consistency with the @@Docstring's intent.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code. Firstly, the handling of code blocks and HTML tags is inconsistent; the @@Correct Code uses a more structured approach to manage code blocks and ensures that HTML tags are treated appropriately, which enhances clarity and maintainability. Additionally, the @@Existing Code does not utilize the `keepends` parameter in `splitlines`, which could lead to loss of line endings in the output, and it lacks the robust handling of special characters and edge cases that the @@Correct Code addresses, such as stripping unwanted characters from tags.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not account for internal links, which is a significant oversight since the correct code includes logic to skip modifications for links that start with a slash. Additionally, the existing implementation uses a single callback function to add attributes, while the correct code utilizes multiple callbacks for better flexibility and adherence to best practices. Lastly, consider adding parameters like `parse_email` and `skip_tags` to the `linkify` function call to enhance functionality and control over the link processing behavior.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code correctly checks if a tag is empty and verifies that all characters are legal, but it does not align with the @@Correct Code's logic, which instead checks for illegal characters directly. To improve the code, consider revising the character validation logic to ensure it explicitly identifies any illegal characters rather than confirming all characters are legal. Additionally, ensure that the constant `ILLEGAL_TAG_CHARS` is defined within the function or passed as a parameter to maintain clarity and encapsulation.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code correctly checks for illegal characters in a tag, but it does not align with the logic presented in the correct code, which suggests that a tag should be rejected if it contains any character from the `ILLEGAL_TAG_CHARS` set. Instead, it should verify that all characters in the tag are within the allowed set, rather than checking for the presence of illegal characters. Additionally, consider using a more efficient approach, such as a set for `ILLEGAL_TAG_CHARS`, to improve the performance of character lookups.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code attempts to create a dictionary of child nodes keyed by their tag names, but it incorrectly uses a nested comprehension that may lead to incorrect behavior when multiple children share the same tag, as it only retains the last occurrence. Additionally, the handling of `child.text` should ensure that it captures the text for each child node directly, rather than creating lists, which deviates from the expected output format described in the docstring. To improve, consider simplifying the logic to directly map each tag to its corresponding text, ensuring that if multiple children share the same tag, they are appropriately handled, possibly by aggregating their texts in a list or another suitable structure.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not fully align with the @@Docstring, as it constructs the NodeInfo document with two schema links instead of one, which is present in the @@Correct Code; this could lead to unnecessary redundancy. Additionally, the URL construction could be optimized by using a more flexible formatting approach, similar to the one in the @@Correct Code, which enhances readability and maintainability. Lastly, ensure that the function adheres to the expected input types and handles potential edge cases, such as validating the URL format.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code correctly constructs a NodeInfo .well-known document but deviates from the correct code in two key areas: it uses an outdated schema version (2.0 instead of 1.0) and has a less concise URL formatting approach. To improve, consider adopting the string formatting method used in the correct code for better readability and maintainability, and ensure the schema version aligns with the latest specifications. Additionally, ensure that the function's docstring is included within the function definition for clarity and completeness.

The @@Existing Code has several issues that deviate from the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. Firstly, it does not utilize the `public_key` parameter when importing the RSA key, which is essential for signature verification. Additionally, the signature is not being decoded from its base64 format before verification, which is necessary to ensure that the verification process is accurate. To improve the code, ensure that the public key is correctly passed to `importKey` and that the signature is decoded using `b64decode` before calling the `verify` method.

Additionally, the error handling could be more specific; instead of catching all exceptions broadly, it would be beneficial to catch only relevant exceptions to avoid masking potential issues in the parsing logic. Lastly, consider enhancing logging messages to provide clearer context about the parsing process and errors encountered, which aids in debugging and understanding the flow of execution.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains an error in the way it extracts the host from the handle; it should use `split('@')[1]` instead of `split('@')[2]`, as the latter would lead to an `IndexError` if the handle does not contain a third element. Additionally, the formatting of the log messages should be consistent with the correct code, using double quotes for strings, which enhances readability and maintains style consistency. Finally, consider adding a check to ensure that the handle contains the '@' character before attempting to split it, which would further improve robustness against invalid inputs.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code lacks the structured approach and error handling present in the @@Correct Code, particularly in how it retrieves and processes the webfinger document. It should utilize the `try_retrieve_webfinger_document` and `retrieve_diaspora_host_meta` functions to ensure a more robust retrieval process, along with handling potential exceptions and ensuring the URL is correctly constructed using the host meta information. Additionally, the parsing logic should be encapsulated in a separate function like `parse_diaspora_webfinger` to improve modularity and maintainability.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a few areas for improvement compared to the correct code. First, it should utilize the `try_retrieve_webfinger_document` function directly to simplify the retrieval process and avoid redundant calls to `retrieve_diaspora_host_meta` if the document is already accessible. Additionally, the construction of the webfinger URL should leverage the `find_link` method for better clarity and reliability, ensuring that the correct link is fetched based on the specified relationship type, which enhances maintainability and adheres to the expected API interactions. Lastly, consider returning `None` instead of an empty dictionary when the retrieval fails, as this aligns better with the expected output described in the docstring.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code. Firstly, it lacks the use of a dedicated function like `try_retrieve_webfinger_document`, which would encapsulate the retrieval logic and error handling, making the code cleaner and more modular. Additionally, the existing code directly constructs the webfinger URL and handles exceptions in a less structured manner; adopting a more robust approach using `fetch_document` would enhance error management and clarity in the retrieval process. Lastly, ensure that the handle is properly quoted to avoid issues with special characters when constructing the URL.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code lacks the implementation details necessary to retrieve the Diaspora host-meta document, as it only initializes the `XRD` variable without performing any operations to fetch or parse the document.

Instead of using a generic exception handler, consider implementing specific checks for the response from `fetch_document`, which can provide clearer insights into the nature of any issues encountered.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several areas for improvement: first, it should return `None` immediately upon encountering an error in fetching the document, rather than raising a `ValueError` and then catching it, which adds unnecessary complexity. Additionally, the @@Correct Code indicates that the `fetch_document` function returns a tuple that includes an error flag, which should be utilized to streamline error handling and avoid the need for a try-except block. Finally, the parsing should directly reference the `XRD` class for clarity and consistency with the expected return type in the docstring.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several deviations from the @@Correct Code and @@Docstring that need addressing. Firstly, the check for an empty method should be `if not method:` instead of `if method == ""`, as this is more Pythonic and accounts for other falsy values. Secondly, the return statement after a successful request should return the actual `response.status_code` rather than returning `None`, which contradicts the expected output described in the docstring. Lastly, ensure that the error handling correctly returns `None` for the status code when an exception occurs, aligning with the intended output format.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not handle the case where the input dictionary (`dic`) is `None`, which could lead to runtime errors; adding a check for this condition would enhance robustness. Additionally, the @@Existing Code does not utilize the `dict_merge` function from the @@Oracle Context, which is present in the @@Correct Code and is useful for merging dictionaries when both the existing value and the new value are dictionaries. Lastly, the @@Correct Code uses `setdefault` to simplify the creation of nested dictionaries, which improves readability and efficiency compared to the manual check in the @@Existing Code.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has a few issues compared to the correct code and the docstring. First, the handling of `None` for the input dictionary should return without doing anything instead of returning `None`, which is more consistent with the correct code. Additionally, the use of `dict_merge` in the existing code does not correctly merge the dictionaries when the target key already exists, as it should directly merge into `dic[key]` rather than assigning it first. Lastly, the recursive call to `dict_insert` should be made on the result of `setdefault`, ensuring that the nested structure is properly traversed.

The existing code does not align with the correct code, as it incorrectly places `spec_option` as the third argument instead of the fourth, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when interacting with the `ListOfFileNames` API. Additionally, the docstring suggests that the function is intended to create a complex type, but it lacks clarity on the parameters and their expected types, which could be improved for better understanding.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code introduces a conditional check (`some_condition`) that is not mentioned in the docstring or the correct code, which could lead to unexpected behavior or confusion regarding the function's purpose. To improve clarity and maintain consistency with the docstring, consider removing the conditional logic unless it is explicitly required, ensuring that the function always returns the `ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER`. Additionally, ensure that any conditions affecting the service retrieval are documented clearly in the docstring to maintain transparency about the function's behavior.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not raise an exception when `spec_content` is `None`, which contradicts the @@Docstring's expectation of raising an `IRValidatorException` in such cases. Additionally, it lacks validation for the structure of the loaded YAML data, which is crucial to ensure that it is a dictionary and not empty or corrupted, as highlighted in the @@Correct Code. Finally, the @@Existing Code does not implement any schema validation or checks for specific fields, which are important for ensuring the integrity of the spec content as described in the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

The @@Existing Code lacks comprehensive validation for the structure of the YAML content, particularly regarding the presence of nested fields and the use of JSON schema validation, which is present in the @@Correct Code. Additionally, the error messages in the @@Existing Code could be more descriptive to aid debugging, such as specifying whether the spec content is empty or corrupted.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code generally adheres to the @@Docstring but lacks comprehensive validation and error handling compared to the @@Correct Code. Specifically, it does not utilize JSON schema validation, which is crucial for ensuring the integrity of the spec content structure, and it could provide more informative error messages when the spec content is malformed. Additionally, the @@Existing Code should consider checking for the presence of a "description" field in subparsers, which is highlighted in the @@Correct Code, to ensure all required fields are validated.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code raises a generic `ValueError` for missing fields and file errors, while the @@Correct Code uses a custom exception `IRValidatorException`, which is more appropriate for the context and aligns with the docstring. Additionally, the existing code does not check if the file exists before attempting to open it, which could lead to unnecessary exceptions; incorporating `os.path.isfile` would enhance robustness. Lastly, the existing code directly loads the YAML data without validating its content through a dedicated method, which could be beneficial for maintaining separation of concerns and improving readability.

The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement: first, it should utilize the `validate_from_content` method to validate the YAML data after reading it, as indicated in the @@Correct Code, which enhances modularity and reusability. Additionally, the error messages could be more user-friendly by providing clearer context, such as specifying that the file must be a valid YAML file when it raises exceptions. Lastly, consider removing the redundant `FileNotFoundError` exception handling since the `os.path.isfile` check already ensures the file's existence before attempting to open it.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement: first, it could benefit from a more concise error message format, as seen in the @@Correct Code, which enhances readability and consistency. Additionally, the @@Existing Code reads the YAML file and then validates its content separately, while the @@Correct Code suggests integrating the validation directly after reading the file, which can streamline the process and reduce redundancy. Lastly, consider implementing the method as a class method (as in the @@Correct Code) if it logically belongs to a class, which would enhance organization and encapsulation.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code and @@Correct Code exhibit a key difference in the handling of the default value for options with the action 'store_true'; the @@Correct Code assigns `False` instead of `1`, which is more semantically appropriate since 'store_true' typically indicates a boolean flag. Additionally, the @@Correct Code includes a comment clarifying the intention behind retrieving the environment variable, which enhances code readability and maintainability. To improve the @@Existing Code, consider adding similar comments for clarity and revising the handling of the 'store_true' action to align with standard practices.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code is mostly aligned with the @@Docstring and @@Oracle Context, but there are a few areas for improvement. First, consider ensuring consistency in how you check for the 'action' value; using `in` instead of `==` allows for easier expansion if more actions are added later. Additionally, the log message could be made more concise by removing redundant text, which would enhance readability without losing clarity. Lastly, ensure that the handling of environment variable prefixes, as indicated in the @@Correct Code, is consistently applied to avoid potential mismatches in expected behavior.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few inconsistencies compared to the @@Correct Code, primarily in how it retrieves the environment variable and checks for defaults. First, the existing code uses a hardcoded prefix for the environment variable, while the correct version directly uses the option's name, which is more flexible and adheres to the expected behavior. Additionally, the existing code's checks for 'default' and 'action' could be streamlined using the `get` method to improve readability and reduce potential KeyError exceptions.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
To improve the @@Existing Code, consider the following suggestions: 

1. The current implementation returns a simple dictionary, which may not capture the relationship between deprecated options and their names effectively; instead, use a `defaultdict` to group deprecated arguments by their names, as seen in the @@Correct Code.
2. Ensure that the iteration over `option` includes checks for the presence of a 'deprecates' attribute or key, which is crucial for filtering out non-deprecated options, thus enhancing the accuracy of the returned data.
3. Adding explicit handling for cases where no options are deprecated could improve clarity and maintainability, ensuring that the function's behavior is well-defined even when there are no deprecated arguments.

The existing code does not align with the docstring's intent, as it suggests returning a dictionary of options that deprecate others, but the implementation uses a set to collect deprecated options, which may not accurately reflect the expected structure. Additionally, the correct code indicates that the iteration should yield both a parser and an option, suggesting that the existing code may be missing important context or data needed for accurate processing. Finally, consider using `option.get('deprecates')` instead of checking for attributes directly, as this aligns better with the correct code's approach and may improve compatibility with various data structures.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code lacks the implementation for validating and printing deprecated arguments, which is essential according to the docstring and the correct code. To improve, consider directly integrating the logic from the correct code within the `generate_code` function, ensuring it processes both `cli_args` and `answer_file_args` as intended. Additionally, ensure that any exceptions and logging mechanisms are properly utilized to align with the specified API context and enhance error handling and user feedback.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a nested function structure that complicates readability and may lead to confusion regarding scope and variable access; consider flattening the function to improve clarity.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code primarily checks for deprecated arguments but lacks the comprehensive handling of deprecations found in the correct code, which maps deprecated arguments to their replacements and updates the input dictionaries accordingly. Additionally, the existing implementation raises an exception immediately upon finding a deprecated argument, which may not be ideal for user experience, as it could be more beneficial to log all deprecated usages before raising an exception. Consider restructuring the logic to first collect all deprecated warnings and then handle them collectively, allowing for a more informative output to the user.

The existing code directly accesses `self.parser_options[command_name]`, which may lead to a KeyError if `command_name` is not present, while the correct code iterates through parsers to safely retrieve options, ensuring robustness. Additionally, the correct code includes a docstring that describes the method's functionality, which is missing in the existing code, thus improving clarity and maintainability. To enhance the existing implementation, consider incorporating error handling for invalid command names and adding a docstring to clarify the method's purpose and usage.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement: first, it directly accesses the parser's attributes (e.g., `parser.name`), which may lead to issues if the parser's structure changes; consider using a more flexible approach, such as treating parsers as dictionaries. Second, the code currently returns an empty list if the command is not found, which may mask potential issues; instead, consider raising a specific exception to indicate that the command was not recognized. Lastly, the @@Correct Code suggests breaking the loop after finding the command, which can improve efficiency by avoiding unnecessary iterations once the desired parser is located.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code raises a `ValueError` if the command is not found, which is good for error handling, but it does not return an empty list or any indication of no options found, potentially leading to confusion. Additionally, the @@Correct Code suggests using `self._get_all_options_spec(parser)` instead of `parser._get_all_options_spec()`, which is more explicit about the method's context and improves clarity. Consider implementing a mechanism to return an empty list if no matching command is found, as this aligns better with the expected return type and may simplify handling for the caller.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code incorrectly filters options by checking if `opt['name']` is not equal to `argument_name`, whereas the correct code specifies that it should check for equality.

The @@Existing Code has a few logical discrepancies compared to the @@Correct Code, particularly in how it checks for required arguments and handles the merging of results.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code generally aligns with the docstring, but there are a few areas for improvement. First, the condition checking for required options could be made clearer by explicitly grouping the logical conditions with parentheses to enhance readability. Additionally, the construction of `missing_args` could be simplified using a dictionary comprehension instead of the `dict` constructor, which would improve both clarity and performance. Lastly, consider adding type hints to the function signature to improve code maintainability and clarity regarding expected input and output types.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few areas for improvement that can enhance clarity and maintainability. First, consider using more descriptive variable names, such as renaming `res` to `missing_args_dict`, which would make the purpose of the variable clearer. Additionally, ensure that the logic for checking required options is consistently formatted for readability, as the current structure may lead to confusion; using parentheses to group conditions can help clarify the intent. Finally, verify that all external dependencies, such as `dict_utils`, are appropriately imported and utilized, as this will ensure the code integrates smoothly with the broader application context.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not validate the `required_when` conditions thoroughly, potentially leading to security risks due to the use of `eval`, which can execute arbitrary code. It also lacks handling for cases where `required_when` is not a list, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is not as anticipated. Additionally, the @@Correct Code emphasizes better structure and clarity by separating the validation logic and ensuring that all conditions are checked before appending to the results, which should be adopted for improved maintainability and readability.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not align with the docstring, as it checks if the entire `args` list is in `self.choices`, rather than validating each individual choice against available options. Additionally, the correct code demonstrates a more comprehensive approach by iterating through the arguments and checking each option against its specified choices, which is crucial for handling multiple arguments properly. To improve the existing implementation, consider restructuring it to iterate over the individual choices and maintain a list of invalid options, similar to the correct code, ensuring it adheres to the expected functionality described in the docstring.

The @@Existing Code does not align with the @@Docstring, as it assumes `args` is a list of strings rather than a dictionary of argument names and their corresponding values, which is evident in the @@Correct Code.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code's logic for validating minimum and maximum values is generally sound, but it lacks clarity and extensibility compared to the correct code. Specifically, it could benefit from a more structured approach to handling the argument specifications, as seen in the correct code, which utilizes nested loops and clearer variable naming for better readability. Additionally, the existing code raises an exception directly, while the correct code collects invalid options and returns them, allowing for more flexible error handling and user feedback.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few issues that deviate from the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. First, the method name contains a typo ("argumet" instead of "argument"), which should be corrected for clarity and consistency. Additionally, the @@Existing Code's error handling could be improved by raising exceptions rather than simply printing error messages and returning `None`, as this would allow the caller to handle errors more effectively. Lastly, the @@Correct Code demonstrates a more efficient approach by using `get` to retrieve the complex type constructor and directly passing parameters in a more organized manner, which enhances readability and maintainability.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code lacks the structured approach seen in the @@Correct Code, particularly in how it processes arguments; it should utilize a more systematic parsing method to improve clarity and maintainability. Additionally, the @@Existing Code redundantly checks for duplicates in a less efficient manner, which could be streamlined by consolidating the logic for handling duplicates into a single function or structure. Lastly, the @@Correct Code emphasizes the importance of argument types and specifications, which the @@Existing Code overlooks, suggesting a need to incorporate type checks and specifications to ensure proper handling of nested and custom arguments.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not fully align with the @@Docstring, particularly in how it categorizes and processes arguments, which could lead to incorrect handling of nested and custom arguments. Additionally, it lacks the structured approach seen in the @@Correct Code, such as using a dedicated argument parsing method that leverages `arg_spec` for type checking and categorization, which enhances clarity and maintainability. To improve, consider implementing a similar parsing strategy that distinguishes between argument types more effectively and incorporates detailed logging for better traceability of argument handling.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code and @@Correct Code are largely similar, but a key difference lies in how the value is inserted into `vars_dict` when it does not start with '@'. In the @@Existing Code, the value is modified by appending "_modified", which may not align with the intended functionality described in the @@Docstring. To improve the code, ensure that the insertion logic is consistent with the expected behavior, and consider validating the format of `extra_vars` more robustly to prevent potential runtime errors.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code does not fully align with the @@Docstring, particularly regarding the handling of verbosity and the integration of the `ir_workspace` and `ir_plugin` parameters, which are not utilized in the command execution. Additionally, it lacks the logging functionality present in the @@Correct Code, which provides better debugging insights and error handling. To improve, consider implementing the proper Ansible API as suggested in the TODO comment and ensure that all parameters are effectively utilized to maintain consistency with the intended functionality described in the docstring.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code primarily focuses on constructing a command to run the Ansible playbook via the CLI, while the @@Correct Code suggests using a more integrated approach with Ansible's API, which is generally more robust and maintainable. One key improvement would be to replace the subprocess call with a direct invocation of Ansible's internal methods, as indicated in the @@Correct Code, to avoid issues related to command-line parsing and error handling. Additionally, consider ensuring that the verbosity and extra variables are handled consistently and that the logging captures all relevant information for debugging purposes, as this can significantly aid in troubleshooting.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several issues that deviate from the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. First, the handling of command-line arguments is incomplete, particularly in the `cli_args.extend()` calls, which lack the necessary arguments, and the temporary file's name is not correctly utilized for passing extra variables to Ansible. Additionally, the error logging and exception handling could be improved by providing more informative messages and ensuring that all relevant context is captured, as seen in the @@Correct Code. Finally, the use of `bool()` without arguments and the absence of specific formatting in logging statements indicate a misunderstanding of how to properly implement these functions, which could lead to runtime errors or unclear logs.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several areas for improvement compared to the @@Correct Code. Firstly, the handling of command-line arguments should consistently use `--extra-vars` instead of `-e` for better clarity and adherence to Ansible's conventions, which enhances readability and maintainability. Additionally, the logging and error handling could be more consistent; for instance, the debug messages should provide clearer context about the execution state, and the error logging should be more structured to facilitate troubleshooting. Lastly, consider refactoring the environment variable checks into a dedicated function to improve code readability and reduce redundancy.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code has several areas for improvement compared to the correct code. First, it should avoid using a temporary file for Ansible variables and instead utilize the Ansible vars object directly, as suggested in the comments of the correct code. Additionally, the error handling could be enhanced by ensuring that the `OSError` is managed properly when creating directories, and it should also ensure that the logging behavior is consistent with the environment variables, which is not fully addressed in the existing implementation. Finally, consider using `json.dump` for saving variables in JSON format instead of YAML, as this aligns with the correct code's approach.
Here is some additional feedback information from the test cases and static analysis tools for your reference:

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code contains a few issues that deviate from the intended functionality described in the docstring and the correct code. Firstly, it uses an infinite loop (`while True`) without a clear exit condition, which can lead to an endless execution; instead, a `for` loop iterating over `values_dict.items()` is more appropriate. Additionally, the variable `opt_name` is referenced without being defined in the existing code, which could result in a runtime error; ensuring that `opt_name` is correctly derived from the dictionary is crucial for proper functionality. Lastly, the existing code does not handle cases where the value cannot be converted to an integer, which should be considered to avoid potential exceptions.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The existing code does not align with the docstring's description, as it attempts to flatten all YAML files in a directory instead of focusing on a specific plugin specification file, which is indicated by the `PLUGIN_SPEC` variable in the correct code. Additionally, the existing code lacks error handling for file operations and YAML parsing, which could lead to runtime exceptions if the specified directory or files are not structured as expected. To improve the code, consider implementing targeted file access using the `PLUGIN_SPEC`, adding error handling for file I/O and YAML loading, and ensuring that the returned dictionary contains only the relevant properties as outlined in the correct code.

The @@Existing Code does not fully align with the @@Docstring, as it only flattens the entire YAML structure instead of extracting specific properties like the plugin name, description, and type, which are crucial for the intended functionality.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code raises an error if `self.ansible_config_path` is not defined, which is a good safety measure, but it could be improved by using `os.environ.get()` to check for the 'ANSIBLE_CONFIG' variable, simplifying the condition and avoiding the need for an explicit check against `None`. Additionally, the @@Correct Code suggests a more concise way to check if the environment variable is undefined, which enhances readability and reduces potential errors. Finally, ensure that the method adheres to the expected behavior of setting the environment variable only if it is truly undefined, as described in the @@Docstring.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several discrepancies compared to the @@Correct Code, particularly in the argument handling for the `checkout`, `delete`, and `list` commands, where the action flags should be `store_true` instead of `store_false`, and the `nargs` for the `delete` command should be `+` instead of `*` to ensure at least one workspace name is provided. Additionally, the `dest` parameter for the `--active` flag in the `list` command should be consistent with the intended behavior, which is to print only the active workspace when the flag is set. Lastly, ensure that the help descriptions are clear and consistent, as minor typos can lead to confusion for users.

The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has several issues compared to the @@Correct Code, particularly in the handling of argument names and help descriptions. For instance, the `create_parser` should use "name" instead of "workspace" for consistency with other commands, and the help descriptions should be more uniform in capitalization and phrasing to enhance readability. Additionally, ensure that the `dest` attributes for arguments are consistently defined to avoid potential conflicts or confusion during command parsing.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code generally aligns with the @@Docstring and @@Oracle Context, but there are several areas for improvement. Firstly, ensure that the help descriptions are consistent in tense and clarity; for example, changing "Manage workspaces" to "Manage workspaces" in the help text can enhance readability. Additionally, consider standardizing argument names and help descriptions across similar commands (e.g., "Name of the workspace" vs. "Workspace name") to maintain consistency and improve user experience. Lastly, verify that all command descriptions accurately reflect their actions, as some descriptions in the @@Existing Code could be more precise, such as "Print the workspace's inventory file" which could be rephrased to "Prints the workspace's inventory file" for uniformity.

@@Feedback
The code is wrong. Please fix it.
The @@Existing Code has a few issues that deviate from the @@Docstring and @@Correct Code. First, the use of `os.path.commonprefix()` is incorrect as it requires a tuple of paths to compare, and the second argument in `os.path.relpath()` is improperly specified; it should only include the `start` parameter. Additionally, the exception message should be formatted consistently, and the trailing separator handling in `rstrip()` should be explicitly defined to avoid potential issues with different path formats.
