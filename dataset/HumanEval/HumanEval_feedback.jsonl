Additionally, it's a good practice to handle input validation to ensure that `n` is non-negative, as the Fibonacci sequence is not defined for negative numbers. Lastly, reconsider using memoization or iterative approaches to improve performance, especially for larger values of `n`, as the current recursive approach can lead to exponential time complexity.", "simple_feedback": "The code is wrong.
